# Shopping Advisor roadmap

The plan of record for this repository. It supersedes the P0–P6 hypothesis
that preceded it; that hypothesis is kept below, with the verdict on each
item, because the reasoning is what makes the current order defensible.

**Status legend:** `DONE` · `IN PROGRESS` · `NEXT` · `PLANNED` · `DEFERRED` ·
`DROPPED`

| | Milestone | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **R0** | Pasta V1 — evidence-backed comparison over existing records | **DONE** |
| **R1** | Crawl provenance and evidence preservation | **DONE** |
| **R2** | Generic validation layer + published extraction contract | **DONE** |
| **R3** | Variation-aware product families | **DONE** (one criterion unmet — see below) |
| **R4** | Amazon.com as a validated marketplace | DEFERRED |
| **R5** | Reviews as an evidence source | **DONE** (cost estimate was wrong — see below) |
| **R6** | A command line for the things every category needs | **DONE** (two of four items were already shipped — see below) |
| **R7** | Attributed search: finding a claim vs crediting it | **DONE** |
| **R8** | Marketplace-aware text matching | **DONE** |
| **R9** | A second pass for missing prices | PLANNED (behind a decision test) |
| **R10** | Scoring as a shared facility | **DEFERRED** — one consumer is not two |
| **R11** | Category synthesis as a default step | PLANNED |
| **R12** | Discovery that states its own coverage | PLANNED |
| **R13** | The conversation as the entry point | PLANNED |
| **R14** | A recommendation in a category nobody validated | PLANNED (needs R10, R11) |

## Product vision — the shopping conversation

**Recorded 2026-09-16. None of this is current behaviour.** It is written down
so that R11–R14 below can be read against a destination instead of as four
unrelated ideas, and so that the distance between each step and what ships
today is a number somebody can argue with.

The flow this project is ultimately for:

1. A user describes a purchase in their own words, as broadly as they like.
2. One round of clarifying questions — the few that change the answer.
3. The agent researches the category. If one ships, it uses it. **If none
   ships, it builds one — as a normal step, not as an offer the user has to
   accept.**
4. It collects the options the marketplace actually has for that question.
5. It comes back with a recommendation, its alternatives, and what would
   change it.

Where each step stands:

| Step | Today | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| 1–2. Describe and clarify | Shipped as **procedure**: [Agree the brief](RESEARCH.md#agree-the-brief) and the validated brief artifact (T2) | It is a runbook an agent follows, not a flow the product offers — R13 |
| 3. Use a category | Shipped. Three categories, `--category` on every command | — |
| 3. Build a category | Possible, as a scoped maintenance change a human reviews; the runbook tells the agent to **offer it as a choice** | Becoming the default is R11, and it is the largest single change in this list |
| 4. Collect the options | Shipped, bounded. Search, direct ASINs, retained pages | "All relevant options" is not reachable by search alone, and this repository has measured it twice — R12 |
| 5. Recommend | Shipped for a declared axis, with exclusions and refusals (T2) | A fresh category has no validated axis to declare, which is R14 and unblocks R10 |

### What the vision does not change

Three things are load-bearing and survive all of it. Recording them here is
cheaper than rediscovering them under deadline:

- **The architecture boundary holds.** A synthesized category is still a
  profile, a classifier, a list of claims and a set of axes, sitting
  downstream of the JSONL. The acquisition layer still never learns what good
  pasta is. R2 established this with a second category and nothing in this
  vision needs it relaxed.
- **The trust vocabulary holds.** `trusted` still means the applicable checks
  passed. A category invented ten minutes ago cannot promote a value, and it
  must not be able to.
- **Refusal is still a result.** The end state is *not* "always produces a
  recommendation". It is "produces one where the evidence supports it, and
  says so precisely where it does not" — which is what T2's
  `insufficient_evidence` outcome is for.

### The honest risk, stated once

Every failure this repository has paid for has the same shape: something that
was true for one buyer became a fact about a product class, and no later
reader could tell the difference. Tyre mounting paste ranks the smallest pack
first because one reader was fitting one scooter tyre. Basmati's score weights
come from one particular question.

A category **written during a study, from that study's brief**, is that
failure mechanized. T2 built the separation that makes the vision safe —
constraints live in the brief, and the study report says of every decision
whether the brief stated it or the category supplied it — and R11 is only
defensible on top of it. Building the generator without the separation would
be faster and would produce a machine for laundering one user's preferences
into permanent product knowledge.

## Agent-operation transition

### Product identity — 2026-09-16

The crawler-era name `amazon-scrapy-scraper` described acquisition but omitted
the brief, validation, category reasoning, comparison and saved-study layers
already delivered. The project is now **shopping-advisor**, with the Python
namespace `shopping_advisor` and a product entry point:
`python -m shopping_advisor study|analysis|run ...`. Each command delegates
to its existing layer; Amazon-specific source names remain explicit.
See [migration instructions](README.md#project-name-and-migration).

Measured effect: 41 existing modules moved to the product namespace; their
logic is unchanged. The offline suite passes **433 tests** (428 existing,
five product CLI integration tests), including the unchanged extraction and
validation snapshots. The bronze-die example still produces study ID
`pasta-bronze-die-501d864a1a0c`, five eligible offers and three shortlisted
offers, and its saved bundle verifies through the product CLI. Only the root
project name changed in the lockfile; dependency versions remain pinned.
Schema, validation and study contract versions are unchanged because their
data and decision semantics did not move. R11–R14 remain planned.

The reviewed [transition plan](AGENT_TRANSITION_PLAN.md) adds T0–T5 without
replacing the R0–R10 history. Current operating rules are in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), with a shared research workflow in
[RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md) and a thin `CLAUDE.md` entry point.

**T0 — DONE (2026-09-16): make the current system navigable.**

- Added canonical instructions, the provider adapter, and a no-network research
  walkthrough using the committed pasta cases, including a refusal example.
- Replaced the stale README with current setup, architecture, supported scope,
  commands and limitations. Corrected schema versions, `validated` profile
  semantics, basmati rank/JSON claims, and original-report reproducibility claims.
  Historical investigations now identify their age and current successors.
- Removed `amazon_search` after the tracked-reference inventory found no import,
  code consumer or test dependency outside the spider. The README explains the
  migration to `amazon_product` and the different output/acquisition scope.
- Verification: locked environment check succeeded with a writable local uv
  cache; **323 tests passed**. All seven documented offline analysis commands
  succeeded with the stated counts, evidence and refusals. Spider discovery
  returned only `amazon_product`. PowerShell configuration and Git Bash POSIX
  configuration/refusal commands passed; local documentation links and whitespace
  checks passed. No extractor or trust-rule behavior changed.
- Verification limits: used the existing Windows environment, not a fresh
  Linux installation; no live crawl or model-provider acceptance trial was run.
  Provider interchangeability trials remain T4. T1–T5 are not implemented.

**T1 — DONE (2026-09-16): make acquisition and replay safe to build upon.**

- **Run identity.** The ID was a digest of second-resolution time, marketplace
  and arguments — the three things two concurrent crawls of one shelf agree on
  — and `open()` accepted an existing directory. It now carries random bytes
  and the directory is created exclusively; a collision raises
  `RunDirectoryExists` and writes nothing.
- **Manifest.** Written through a temporary file and renamed, and carrying its
  own `state`, so a crawl killed mid-flight reads as `interrupted` rather than
  as one that was never asked to close. It records the code revision and dirty
  flag, the lock digest, schema/contract versions, an **allowlist** of
  acquisition settings — never a credential — and the feeds the crawl was told
  to write. New `run inspect` reads all of it back.
- **Per-observation metadata.** `pages.jsonl` records each retained artefact's
  fetch time, request/final URL, HTTP status and the SHA-256 of the bytes
  actually stored, documented as a digest of the *redacted* text rather than of
  Amazon's reply. Replay reads fetch time from there, so copying a bundle no
  longer makes its pages look freshly fetched; a store written before T1 has no
  index and its records carry `fetched_at: null` with
  `fetched_at_source: "unknown"` instead of a filesystem timestamp.
- **Feed and page bindings.** Replay refuses a feed belonging to another crawl
  or marketplace, reports `mixed`/`legacy` lineage rather than inventing
  provenance, and fails the individual page whose stored bytes no longer match
  the recorded digest. Replayed records carry `extracted_at`, which is how a
  merge distinguishes a new reading of old bytes from a new observation.
- **Failure capture.** Challenge pages, titleless PDPs and — on request —
  search responses are retained, redacted, truncated to 256 KB and capped at
  five samples per reason, with the over-cap count recorded.
- **Redaction.** Moved from `tests/corpus/redact.py` into
  `shopping_advisor/redaction.py`; the corpus CLI imports it. The silent
  `except Exception: return html` fallback is gone: a failure is counted and
  the page is quarantined out of the export/promotion path.
- **Marketplace-scoped identity.** Listing identity is the normalised host plus
  the ASIN, in feed merging and in variation family/offer grouping. A two-row
  probe that previously discarded the `.de` observation in favour of a newer
  `.com` one now keeps both. Merge ties fall through a declared order
  (schema, then `extracted_at`, then run id and record digest), so argument
  order never decides. This moved `offer` in the published validated record,
  so **contract v2** with a CONTRACT §7 entry; the corpus diff touched exactly
  `contract_version` on 39 records and `offer[0]` on the 27 with a family.
- **No unrequested comparison.** `rank` refuses an axis the category declares
  no better direction for, and refuses one ordering across two units — on the
  committed mounting-paste cases that was 12 gram packs and 3 millilitre ones
  sorted together — asking for `--unit`. The analysis CLI stops on feeds
  spanning several marketplaces until `--marketplace` names one, and reports
  how many records were set aside.
- **Profiles.** The proxy-free local profile is the Scrapy default;
  `SCRAPY_PROJECT=baseline` still resolves to it for existing commands, and the
  ScrapeOps integration is `SCRAPY_PROJECT=scrapeops` with the key read from
  the environment and no literal in the repository. Verified that none of the
  three ScrapeOps components can be imported on a checkout without the extra,
  which is where the old default failed — at crawl time, not at `scrapy list`.
- Verification: **381 tests passed** (323 before), locked environment, no
  network. All seven documented offline walkthrough commands reproduce their
  stated counts, exclusions and refusals. A scratch run store exercised
  manifest, page index, failure capture, `inspect` and `reextract` end to end.
  `scrapy list` returns `amazon_product` with no `SCRAPY_PROJECT` set and with
  `baseline`.
- Verification limits: still no live crawl, so challenge retention, search-page
  retention and page-write failures were exercised with constructed responses
  rather than against Amazon. Feeds are bound by the run id on their records
  and by the declared feed path, not by a digest taken at close — the feed
  exporter and the run both close on `spider_closed` and nothing orders them.
  Cross-marketplace comparison stays unsupported by decision, not by
  limitation. T2–T5 are not implemented.

**T2 — DONE (2026-09-16): persist and replay a complete offline study.**

- **The brief.** A study now starts from a TOML or JSON brief with a validated
  schema (`shopping_advisor/study/brief.py`, `brief_version = 1`): question,
  category, marketplace, feeds, constraints, freshness policy, assumptions,
  questions, declared sources and limits. Unknown keys are **refused**, not
  ignored — a misspelt constraint that silently does nothing was the failure
  mode this exists to prevent. The brief is data: it names a category by its
  registry key and never by an import path, and a brief naming
  `shopping_advisor.analysis.categories.dry_pasta` gets the same refusal as a
  typo. Feed paths resolve against the brief's own directory, so a brief and
  its feeds travel together and no absolute path enters a committed file.
- **Constraints kept apart from category defaults.** The failure this repays
  is recorded in this file: tyre mounting paste ranks the smallest pack first
  because one reader was fitting one scooter tyre, and that is now
  indistinguishable from a fact about the product class. `report.ranking()`
  reports `axis.stated` and `axis.unit_stated`, and the study report's *What
  decided it* table says of every decision whether the brief chose it or the
  category supplied it.
- **Structured ranking and exclusions.** `rank_text` was the only place a
  ranking existed; it prints twenty rows and **ten** exclusions, and a
  requirement filter removed records with no mention at all. `ranking()` now
  returns the rows, the complete exclusions with a stable `reason_code` each,
  and the requirement-filtered records separately. Measured on the committed
  pasta cases with `--require bronze_die`: 5 rows, 3 exclusions, and **14
  records the text view never named**. `rank --json` exposes it; `rank_text`
  renders it and its output is byte-identical to before.
- **Complete category JSON.** `card_json` named `drying` and `suitability` by
  hand, so basmati's JSON card omitted the whole of what that category knows.
  A category now declares its card keys in `Category.extras`; basmati
  publishes **6** more sections — grain type, cultivar, declaration conflict,
  review signals, external test, and the seven-part score — taking its JSON
  card from 5,483 to 9,974 bytes on the module's own test record. A key a
  category adds and does not declare is not published.
- **The bundle.** `data/studies/<study_id>/` holds `manifest.json`,
  `brief.json`, `candidates.jsonl` (one line per considered record, with the
  reason for its fate), `cards.jsonl` (the complete card of every classified
  candidate), `ranking.json` and a generated `report.md`. On the worked
  example that is 25 candidates and 22 cards, against a text ranking that
  showed 14 rows and truncated its exclusions.
- **A derived identity.** Unlike a crawl id, which must carry random bytes
  because two identical crawls are two observations, a study is a pure
  function of a brief and some pinned bytes. The id is a digest of the brief,
  the input digests and the published schema/contract versions:
  `pasta-bronze-die-501d864a1a0c` is what any checkout produces. It
  deliberately does **not** cover the analysis code, and `verify` is what
  catches a decision that moved because a rule changed.
- **Determinism.** Every artefact except the manifest is byte-identical
  between two runs, and between two directories: the report carries no
  timestamp and no hostname, and the persisted brief carries the file's name
  rather than the path it was invoked by. The manifest declares its own
  variation in a `volatile` list (`started_at`, `finished_at`, `code`,
  `directory`, `brief_source`), and a test asserts that nothing else moves.
- **Refusal as a result.** `minimum_candidates` and `decisive_margin` are
  declared in the brief before the data is seen, so `insufficient_evidence`
  and `no_decisive_winner` are criteria that were met rather than judgements
  improvised at the end. A refusing study puts nobody forward and still
  accounts for all 25 records. Two refusals are instead *errors* that write
  nothing: a brief naming a unit nothing is measured in while other units
  are, and a brief leaving the unit open where several are measured. Filing
  an operator's slip as insufficient evidence would record it as a fact about
  the shelf.
- **`verify`.** Re-derives the decisions from the bundle's own brief and
  inputs and reports, in order: an unsupported manifest or brief version, a
  missing or altered artefact, an input whose digest moved, a code revision
  that changed, and finally the decision or numeric claim that no longer
  reproduces — named, not counted. `--input-root` is authoritative when given.
- **Two worked examples**, both offline over `tests/cases/pasta_v1.jsonl.gz`.
  `pasta-bronze-die` recommends `B0DQ2N5HRW` at 2.96 EUR/kg, 9.1% ahead of the
  runner-up. `pasta-low-temperature-drying` refuses: two listings state the
  requirement and **both** have a disputed price per kilogram, because Amazon
  quotes a unit price per piece and the pack size contradicts it.
- Verification: **428 tests passed** (381 before), locked environment, no
  network. Both bundles reproduce byte-identically across two directories.
  Every failure path was exercised — tampered input, missing artefact,
  unsupported manifest and brief versions, seven kinds of invalid brief, an
  absent unit — and each names what to change. The seven documented offline
  walkthrough commands still reproduce their stated counts, and `rank`'s text
  output is unchanged.
- Verification limits: no live crawl and no second provider stack. The study
  id does not cover the analysis code, by design. Nothing checks that the
  report's *prose* claims are supported by evidence, and a brief's declared
  `[[sources]]` are reproduced with a heading saying they were not verified —
  both are T3. `report.md` is generated, so a hand-written section on top of
  it is unchecked. T3–T5 are not implemented.

**Runbook — requirement elicitation and the improvement loop (2026-09-16).**
Audit of the documents against the actual end-to-end flow found two gaps that
T0 and T1 had left: elicitation was one policy sentence in each of `AGENTS.md`
and `RESEARCH.md` with no procedure under it, and the improvement cycle existed
only in the transition plan, which is a reviewed proposal rather than operating
instruction.

- `RESEARCH.md` now has **Agree the brief**: inspect before asking; a
  blocking / assumable / not-worth-asking test for missing information; one
  batched round with stated defaults so silence is still usable; the
  unsupported-category conversation as an explicit choice; read-back before
  collection; and what to do when a requirement changes mid-study.
- `RESEARCH.md` now has **the improvement cycle** — observation → reproducible
  case → proposed change → review → versioned adoption → measured effect —
  with the promotion table and a closing step that revises the *questions*
  against what actually decided the answer. `AGENTS.md` requires a measured
  effect in the maintenance report.
- Measured while writing it: running the 34 committed mounting-paste records
  under dry pasta's plausibility profile moves **14 values**, mostly `trusted`
  to `disputed` (a 252 EUR/kg paste is outside pasta's 0.80–40 band). That is
  the quiet half of the `--category` default; the classifier makes the loud
  half obvious. An earlier draft of this warning overstated the loud half and
  was corrected against the measurement.
- Documentation change only: no code, no snapshots, 381 tests unchanged and
  green. Links, anchors and the CLI defaults were verified.

## Decision principles

These are the tie-breakers. When a proposal conflicts with one of them, the
principle wins unless new measurement overrides it.

1. **Product value over scraper sophistication.** Extraction complexity is
   only worth what it changes in a research answer.
2. **Evidence over speculation.** Measured crawl behaviour, real records and
   the corpus test beat assumptions about Amazon.
3. **Correctness over coverage.** A missing value is better than a
   confidently wrong one. `unknown` is a legitimate output.
4. **Preserve evidence.** Never discard source material because the parser
   does not yet understand it.
5. **Avoid unnecessary re-crawling.** Prefer offline interpretation of
   records we already hold.
6. **Keep category logic downstream.** The acquisition layer must never learn
   what "good pasta" means.
7. **Avoid premature marketplace abstraction.** Generalise where commonality
   is observed; adapt where structural difference is measured.
8. **Traceability matters.** Every value and every recommendation must be
   traceable to the source text it came from.

## R0 — Pasta V1: evidence-backed comparison over existing records

**Status: DONE** · no crawl required · runs offline over existing JSONL

Shipped as `shopping_advisor/analysis/`, with `tests/test_analysis.py` and the
evidence it was built from in `tests/cases/`.

### Outcome

A user can ask "which of these is better dry pasta, and why?" and get an
answer traceable to the exact source sentence.

### Why this is first

The repository contains no consumer of the extraction output. A contract
cannot be stabilised (R2) and provenance cannot be prioritised (R1) without
one — and measurement shows the current trust semantics are wrong in a way
only a consumer exposes:

- `nutrition.confidence: "high"` records fail plausibility checks **more**
  often than `"medium"` ones — 5/45 vs 2/40 on the 195-record validation set.
  Confidence currently describes the extraction *method*, not the value.
- Price per kg, the axis the whole use case rests on, is silently wrong on at
  least 8 of 163 dry-pasta records. `B08JLSVW3J` (16 × 500 g Garofalo
  Gragnano) reports **€62.56/kg** instead of ≈€3.91/kg; `B0173KFFIG` (12 ×
  500 g Gragnano box) reports **€0.32/kg** instead of ≈€6.47/kg. Both would
  be ejected from any ranking.

### Scope

- Dry-pasta classification from breadcrumbs and the ingredient declaration.
  (The 195-record search output also contains a toilet brush, a cookbook,
  ready meals, chilled pasta and spice blends. Classification is not
  optional.)
- Comparison axes, each carrying the verbatim source quote and its field of
  origin: **price per kg**, **raw material**, **production-method claims**
  (bronze die, slow drying, low-temperature drying), **origin claims** (Italy,
  Gragnano IGP/DOP, Italian wheat), **protein per 100 g**.
- Validation of exactly those axes: package-quantity conflict detection,
  price-per-kg plausibility, nutrition mass balance and Atwater coherence,
  unit-versus-field agreement, and rejection of a matched number that is
  itself part of the basis phrase.
- An explicit `unknown` state, distinct from "absent" and from "conflicting".

### Explicitly out of scope

A general validation framework; a numeric quality score; variation/family
grouping; any change to the spider; any new marketplace; nutrition coverage
work; touching `amazon_search.py`.

### Done when

- [x] Every product is classified or explicitly unclassified.
- [x] Every surfaced price per kg either passes conflict detection or is
      shown as disputed with the conflicting evidence attached.
- [x] The nine known-bad quantity records are each corrected or flagged, and
      none is silently ranked: `B08JLSVW3J`, `B08HQSZR3D`, `B0173KFFIG`,
      `B0BG28G6SZ`, `B0C3WCFKHT`, `B0C5XK2QFR`, `B0BTPZ7TXJ`, `B0CH3MHVF8`,
      `B0GQ5BKHPT`.
- [x] The seven implausible nutrition records are suppressed or marked, never
      presented as fact: `B0C3WCFKHT`, `B089HJPK5T`, `B0FWXQ6NWM`,
      `B0FWXCDCYV`, `B07NZ1K8L3`, `B086K1MFSL`, `B0BP2QDLPQ`.
- [x] A regression test pins each of those cases to the rule that catches it.

> `B0CH3MHVF8` is listed because a crude detector flagged it; the reconciler
> shows it as **corroborated**, not disputed — its 2 500 g total is correct
> ("(1 x 500 g) (Packung mit 5)"). It is in the list as a false-positive
> guard.

### Measured on completion

Over the 195-record Amazon.de validation set:

| | |
|---|---|
| Classified | 161 dry pasta · 34 other · **0 unclassified** |
| Price per kg | 137 trusted · 12 disputed · 5 unverified · 7 unknown |
| Pack quantity | 88 trusted · 12 disputed · 54 unverified · 7 unknown |
| Raw material | 88 trusted (ingredient declaration) · 50 unverified (marketing text) · 23 unknown |
| Protein per 100 g | 52 trusted · 8 disputed · 1 unverified · 6 unknown · 94 not published |
| **Comparable** | **143 of 161** have at least one trusted comparison axis |

Claims found, of 161: made in Italy 62 · bronze die 56 · Gragnano IGP 46 ·
Italian wheat 42 · low-temperature drying 28 · slow drying 22.

Two findings worth carrying forward:

- **Building the consumer changed the rules.** An earlier reconciler disputed
  19 prices; six of those were its own false positives. Multiplying a title's
  pack count by the attribute table's item weight is circular — whether that
  weight is per item or per pack is the question under dispute — and
  `"Packung mit 500g"` read as a fifty-pack because a regex backtracked
  `500` down to `50`. Both are now guarded by named tests. This is the
  argument against promoting these rules to a generic layer (R2) before a
  second category has exercised them.
- **E4 is answered: 143 of 161, far above the 60 threshold.** V1 does not need
  to reframe as an evidence-gap report.

---

## R1 — Crawl provenance and evidence preservation

**Status: DONE.** It was a gate on the next production crawl, and it landed
before one ran.

Shipped as `shopping_advisor/run.py` plus the spider wiring, with
`tests/test_run.py` and the first saved search page in
`tests/corpus/amazon_de_search/`.

### Outcome

A crawl becomes reproducible and auditable, and future extraction work stops
requiring a re-crawl.

### Scope

- `run_id`, run start time, spider arguments and the **acquisition locale**
  (today implicit in `Accept-Language` in `settings_baseline.py`) written to a
  run manifest and onto every record.
- One discovery-occurrence record per (run, query, search page, position,
  ASIN, sponsored flag, search-result title, search-result price), emitted
  **before** the dedupe check. PDP fetching stays deduplicated; today a repeat
  sighting is dropped before anything is recorded, so the evidence is lost.
- The raw `dimensionValuesDisplayData` / twister blob captured verbatim, with
  no interpretation. It is present on 24 of 35 corpus pages and carries the
  labels that resolve the quantity conflicts R0 can only flag
  (`"500 g (16er Pack)"`).
- Retain fetched PDP HTML — measured at 390 KB gzipped / 2.1 MB raw per page,
  ≈76 MB for a 195-product run.
- Version the product evidence set: `data/` is gitignored, so the corpus this
  roadmap rests on exists on one machine only.

### Explicitly out of scope

Separate entity files or tables for hits versus products; any locale
abstraction layer; any change to pacing, proxying or headers; interpreting the
variation blob.

### Done when

- [x] A fresh three-query crawl produces a run manifest.
- [x] A complete occurrence log in which one ASIN found under two queries
      appears twice.
- [x] A locale field on every record.
- [x] An offline re-extraction from retained HTML with no network access.

### Measured on completion

Verification crawl: 3 queries, 1 search page each, 10 products per query,
Amazon.de, no proxy. 34 requests, 34 × HTTP 200, 0 retries, 0 challenges,
`finish_reason: finished`.

| | |
|---|---|
| Discovery occurrences | **213**, of **170** distinct ASINs |
| Repeat sightings | **43 (20% of occurrences)** — 21 same-query pairs, 12 ASINs under more than one query |
| Sponsored placements | **69 of 213 (32%)** of what a shopper is shown |
| Outside the result grid | 33 of 213 (carousels and ad slots) |
| PDPs fetched | 30 — fetching stayed de-duplicated |
| Records with `run_id` and `locale` | 30/30 |
| Pages retained | 30, 11.6 MB gzipped (≈387 KB each, as estimated) |
| Offline re-extraction | **30/30 identical**, no network |
| Variation matrix captured | 16/30 records; 24/34 corpus pages |

Three findings worth carrying forward:

- **A latent locale bug was already in the repository.** Scrapy ships
  `Accept-Language: en` by default and the non-baseline settings profile never
  overrode it, so every Amazon.de crawl on that profile asked Amazon for
  English while reading the answer with German label lists. Nothing failed;
  records would simply have carried an empty `attributes` block beside a full
  `raw_tables`. The gate now refuses to start, with a message naming the fix.
  Only the validated baseline profile was ever correct, and by accident of
  having been written for amazon.de.
- **The discovery selector was never the result list.** On a live search page
  it matches 82 nodes, of which 60 are the result grid and 22 are carousels
  and ad slots — 12 of those with an empty `data-asin`. That is why position 1
  was missing from every query in the last validation run. Discovery
  behaviour is unchanged; both the raw index and the grid rank are now
  recorded, and the grid rank is the one that means anything.
- **A third of placements are advertising.** Not actionable yet, but it is the
  kind of fact that changes what "what does Amazon show for this query" means,
  and it was previously unrecordable.

## R2 — Generic validation layer + published extraction contract

**Status: DONE.** The hold is released: the milestone's premise was that a
rule earns promotion once a *second* consumer has exercised it, and this
milestone built the second consumer first and promoted afterwards.

Shipped as `shopping_advisor/validation/` and `shopping_advisor/analysis/
categories/`, with **[CONTRACT.md](CONTRACT.md)**, `tests/test_validation.py`,
`tests/test_mounting_paste.py`, a validation snapshot in the corpus test, and
the crawl it was measured on in `data/evidence/`.

### Outcome

Downstream analyzers — the second category, not just pasta — inherit trust
semantics instead of reinventing them, against a documented, versioned record.

### The second category

Tyre mounting paste for a 10-inch pneumatic scooter tyre with an inner tube,
on an aluminium rim. Chosen because it shares almost nothing with dry pasta:
non-food, no nutrition, sold in tubs, tubes, bottles and aerosols, filed by
Amazon under four unrelated departments, and judged on criteria that are not
numeric at all — the paste must *dry after mounting and stop lubricating*, be
safe on rubber, and be free of mineral oil.

Its economics invert too. Pack size is not a discount axis: one scooter tyre
needs a few grams, the shelf is five-kilogram workshop tubs, and the cheapest
paste per kilogram is the worst buy. So it ranks on **smallest pack first**
and refuses price per kilogram as a ranking while still showing it.

### Scope

- Promote the category-neutral rules proven in R0 into a generic layer between
  extraction and category analysis — **done**, as `validation/`, which now
  also owns the *ordering* (`detect → category bands → resolve → promote`)
  that was previously a comment inside the pasta module.
- Replace `nutrition.confidence` with value-level semantics: separate `source`
  from `status` — **done**, schema v4.
- Publish the schema with a stated compatibility policy; bump
  `SCHEMA_VERSION` — **done**, CONTRACT.md, schema v4 / contract v1.

### Done when

- [x] A second category analyzer consumes the contract without re-deriving
      trust rules. Asserted mechanically, not by inspection:
      `tests/test_mounting_paste.py` parses the module's imports and fails if
      it reaches past the contract into `validation.quantity`,
      `validation.pricing` or `validation.nutrition`.
- [x] The corpus regression test covers validation output — a second snapshot,
      `validated.jsonl.gz`, over all 39 saved pages, produced with **no**
      category profile so that what is pinned is the layer belonging to nobody.

### Measured on completion

Second-category crawl: 3 queries, 1 search page each, 30 products per query,
Amazon.de, no proxy. 93 requests, 93 × HTTP 200, 0 retries, 0 challenges,
`finish_reason: finished`. 90 records.

| | dry pasta (195 records) | tyre mounting paste (90 records) |
|---|---|---|
| Classified | 165 · 30 other · **0 unclassified** | 43 · 47 other · **0 unclassified** |
| Pack quantity | 131 trusted · 13 disputed · 14 unverified · 7 unknown | 25 trusted · 1 disputed · 6 unverified · 11 unknown |
| Price per base unit | 100 trusted · 9 disputed · 2 unverified · 54 unknown | 13 trusted · 1 disputed · 1 unverified · 28 unknown |
| **At least one trusted axis** | **117 of 165** | **32 of 43** |

Effect on dry pasta of the two rules the second category forced — same
records, same code path:

| | before | after |
|---|---:|---:|
| Pack quantity trusted | 108 | **131** |
| Pack quantity unverified | 37 | **14** |
| Pack quantity disputed / unknown | 13 / 7 | 13 / 7 *(identical)* |
| Price per base unit trusted | 100 | 100 *(identical)* |
| Protein trusted | 61 | 60 |

Five findings worth carrying forward.

- **Three of the four things the layer had to learn were bugs, not
  generalisations.** The plan assumed promotion would be mostly a move. What
  the second category actually produced was: a price-per-unit path hard-wired
  to kilograms that silently discarded Amazon's own figure whenever it was
  quoted per litre; an extraction bug reporting a 50 ml tin as 50 g, because
  `total_quantity_unit` was inferred from any volume field on the page rather
  than from the row the total came from; and a missing generic rule that would
  have let a *trusted* "100 g of fat per 100 g" through. None of these were
  visible with one consumer, and none of them is category-specific. That is
  the argument R2 was waiting for, and it came out stronger than expected.
- **The missing rule is the cleanest measurement in this repository.**
  German *Fett* means grease as well as fat, so `"Fett wird in einer 100 g
  Tube geliefert"` on bicycle grease parses as a nutrition declaration — with
  the per-100 g basis apparently confirmed. Dry pasta was protected only by
  having a plausibility band. The rule that was missing is category-neutral:
  a declaration carrying a single nutrient has nothing on the page to confirm
  it, so it may be shown and never trusted. **Thirteen lone-nutrient blocks
  exist across the two validation sets and all thirteen are artefacts of
  matching a word** — nine in dry pasta, six of them reporting 100 g of
  protein per 100 g and one reporting 534.
- **R0's refusal to read a bare title weight was right, and too broad.** The
  reasoning was multipacks: `"Garofalo Fusilli 500g"` on a sixteen-pack states
  the weight of one box. Take the multipack away and the ambiguity goes with
  it. Mounting paste does not use multipack phrasing at all — it writes
  `"Reifenmontagepaste 5 kg"` and means it — and only 2 of 43 pastes had a
  confirmable pack size. The rule added is narrow and **asymmetric**: when
  nothing on the page claims more than one unit, a bare weight in the
  listing's own text may *confirm* the attribute total and may never
  contradict it. On dry pasta it moves 23 records from unverified to trusted
  and leaves every disputed and every unknown exactly as it was.
- **A profile is data, and that had to be enforced rather than intended.**
  The first draft let a category pass a callable. The version that shipped
  accepts plausibility bands and a label, and nothing else, because the
  ordering the bands participate in is the part a second category has no way
  to know is load-bearing. `price_band=None` is a legitimate answer: mounting
  paste spans 50 ml tubes and 5 kg tubs two orders of magnitude apart per
  kilogram, and inventing a band to have one would reject real listings.
- **The category answer is an evidence-gap report, and honestly so.** The
  criterion that decides this purchase — does the paste dry out and stop
  lubricating — is stated on **3 of 43 listings**. "Free of mineral oil" and
  "solvent-free" are claimed by **none**. Water-solubility, the usable proxy,
  appears on 6. One listing declares a mineral-oil base, which is the only
  *disqualifying* evidence on the page and is surfaced as an adverse claim.
  A ranking that did not say this would be inventing confidence.

### What the second category could not fix

`price_per_base` is `unknown` on 28 of 43 mounting pastes, because 23 have no
price at all — no purchasable offer at crawl time, the same volatility R3
measured on the pasta set. Not an extraction gap and not fixable downstream.

### Retired from scope

Nothing. The one thing deliberately not built is a `nutrition: bool` flag on
the profile: a non-food record has no food block, the nutrition rules cost it
nothing, and adding a switch would have been a category telling the generic
layer which rules to run — exactly what the profile is shaped to prevent.

---

## R3 — Variation-aware product families

**Status: DONE**, with one of its two completion criteria **not met** and the
reason recorded rather than worked around.

Shipped as `shopping_advisor/analysis/variation.py` plus the reconciler and
report wiring, with `tests/test_variation.py`.

### Outcome

Pack-size variants of one product are compared as a single offer family, and
the "same pasta, sixteen ASINs" distortion disappears from rankings.

### Scope

Interpret the variation blob R1 now captures into a family identity and a
pack-size dimension, and use it as an additional quantity-conflict resolver —
`"500 g (16er Pack)"` is the independent statement that settles the disputes
R0 can only flag.

Also the part of the discovery model R1 deliberately left alone: occurrences
are now persisted separately from products, but nothing *joins* them. Build
that join when there is a consumer for it, and not before.

### Explicitly out of scope

Crawling sibling ASINs that were never discovered.

### Done when

- [x] Variants collapse into one comparison row with per-pack price per kg.
- [ ] **Not met:** family evidence resolves at least the quantity conflicts R0
      could only flag. Seven of R0's eight flagged ASINs reappeared in the
      verification crawl and **none of them has a variation matrix at all**.
      The evidence this milestone was meant to apply does not exist on those
      pages. No amount of further work on variations changes that, so the
      criterion is retired rather than chased.

### Measured on completion

Re-ran the original three-query validation crawl under schema v3: 195 records,
201 requests, 201 × HTTP 200, 0 retries, 0 challenges, `finished`.

| | |
|---|---|
| Variation matrix present | **68/195 (35%)** |
| Dry pastas → offers | 165 listings → **159 offers**; 6 offers hold more than one crawled pack size |
| Pack quantity improved | **22 unverified → trusted**, **2 unverified → disputed** (24 records, 12%) |
| Only pack-size label on the page | 26 records |
| R0's flagged conflicts resolved | **0 of 7** — none carries a matrix |

Four findings.

- **The corpus overstated how common variation data is, and I had used that
  figure to justify this milestone.** "Present on 24 of 35 corpus pages" is
  71%; on records from an ordinary search crawl it is **35%**. The corpus
  pages were chosen for layout diversity, which is exactly the bias that makes
  them a bad basis for a frequency claim. Checked against the retained pages,
  not assumed: where the matrix is missing it is genuinely absent from the
  HTML, not missed by the extractor.
- **The premise in the original review was wrong.** "Sixteen ASINs of the same
  Garofalo pasta crowd the ranking" — those listings are different *shapes*
  under one parent, not pack sizes. Amazon files spaghetti, penne and fusilli
  under a single family, so collapsing by family would have merged different
  products. Grouping is by size dimension only, and the corpus proves that is
  necessary rather than fastidious.
- **The real payoff was the quantity side, not the comparison side.** One case
  matters on its own: `B0DM21MLWV` (Barilla Integrale) was shown by R0 at
  **€38.56/kg** as an unverified but plausible price, because Amazon's
  attribute table says 1 kg and its own unit price is quoted *per piece*. The
  variation matrix says `10kg`. The real price is **€3.86/kg** — a tenfold
  error on a flagship brand, invisible to every source R0 had.
- **Price coverage is volatile between crawls.** The September run had a price
  on 195/195 records; this one on 141/195. Investigated rather than assumed:
  no price payload keyed to the main ASIN exists anywhere in those responses,
  and the discovery log shows search did not price them either. They had no
  purchasable offer at crawl time. The extractor is right to return nothing,
  and §1.4's finding — that no high-value field needs browser execution —
  still holds.

### Retired from scope

The discovery/product *join* stays unbuilt. R1 persists occurrences separately
and nothing reads them yet; this milestone did not create a reader, so the
reasoning that put R0 ahead of P0 applies unchanged — do not model what
nothing consumes.

---

## R4 — Amazon.com as a validated marketplace

**Status: DEFERRED.** Reconsider when a stated user need for US product
research exists. "Architecturally supported" is already true and costs nothing
to keep.

### Scope when it starts

A `.com` validation crawl from a US IP; the US nutrition parser
(`#nic-nutrition-facts`, reversed and merged cells, per-serving basis) plus
serving-size conversion **with validation attached** — per-serving → per-100 g
is a derivation, and derivations produced the worst values on `.de`; `.com`
price and unit-price re-measurement; delete or validate the speculative
`amazon.co.uk` and `amazon.it` profiles (`amazon.it` currently declares German
as its label language, which would map nothing on Italian pages and emit an
empty `attributes` block beside a full `raw_tables`).

### Done when

`.com` coverage and validation figures are comparable to the `.de` run, and US
nutrition either converts correctly or returns `unknown`.

---

## R5 — Reviews as an evidence source

**Status: DONE.** The decision test passed decisively, and the milestone cost
roughly a tenth of what this entry budgeted, for a reason worth recording.

Shipped as `shopping_advisor/extraction/reviews.py` and
`shopping_advisor/validation/reviews.py`, with `tests/test_reviews.py` (33 tests)
and schema v5. Driven by the third category, basmati rice, where the properties
that decide the purchase — does it smell of basmati, does it arrive with moths
in it — are stated nowhere except in reviews.

### The decision test, run

Threshold was ~30% of comparisons ending in "both claim the same thing and
nothing distinguishes them". On 239 basmati listings: **137 (57%) claim
"extra long", 104 (44%) claim a growing region**, and outside price per
kilogram almost nothing on the page separates them. Far over the bar.

### Why the estimate was wrong, and in which direction

This entry priced reviews as **"crawl-graph expansion"** — following
`/product-reviews/` pagination. That was wrong twice:

- **The data was already in hand.** Eight to thirteen review cards and the
  complete ratings histogram are in the PDP HTML the crawler has retained
  since R1. **Zero additional requests**, and both production crawls were
  re-extracted offline to get them.
- **The expensive version is not available at any price.**
  `/product-reviews/<ASIN>` redirects to sign-in. The PDP widget is the only
  review evidence reachable without an account, so there is no larger version
  of this milestone to come back for. Recorded here so nobody re-scopes it.

### What the two structures are, and why they are not interchangeable

| | histogram | rendered sample |
|---|---|---|
| Covers | **every rating the listing ever received** | 8–13 cards Amazon selected |
| Carries | five percentages | the words |
| Sums to 100 | **38 of 38 corpus pages** | — |
| Reconstructs the published average | **within 0.08 stars, worst case** | — |
| May support a rate | **yes** | **never** |

Because the histogram is an independent statement of the same fact the average
asserts, it promotes the average from `unverified` to `trusted` under the
layer's existing corroboration rule — no new rule was needed. And because the
sample is a sample of Amazon's choosing, a complaint found in it establishes
**presence, never frequency**, which the Value says in its own notes.

### The vocabulary needed no extension, and that is the result

The category needed `not_claimed` and `unknown` to mean opposite things for
the same missing sentence:

- a **vendor** controls the whole page, so an absent claim is `not_claimed`;
- **buyers** control nothing — Amazon picked which 13 of 3 446 reviews to
  render — so an absent complaint is `unknown`.

R2's vocabulary already expressed that. Nothing was added to it.

### Measured on completion

| | |
|---|---|
| Corpus pages carrying a review block | **38 of 39** |
| Pages carrying a histogram | **38** |
| Review cards extracted | **277** |
| Written on *another* marketplace | **82 (30%)** — machine-translated onto the page |
| Carrying a variant label | 201 |
| Marked verified purchase | 271 |
| Schema v4 → v5 | **purely additive**; corpus diff touched only `reviews.*` and `blocks_present` |

Three findings worth carrying forward.

- **30% of the "reviews" on an amazon.de page were not written for
  amazon.de.** They are real, and they are about a different importer, a
  different batch and occasionally a different product. Counted apart rather
  than dropped.
- **Amazon pools reviews across pack sizes, and the page says so if you
  read the format strip.** Tilda Pure Original's 10 kg listing shows reviews
  from three pack sizes. This was previously invisible; it is now a flag on
  the value.
- **Splitting the search by star rating was not a refinement, it was
  required.** Searching all reviews for stickiness complaints matches "die
  Körner kleben überhaupt nicht" — a five-star endorsement — and it was the
  single commonest false positive in the category. Positive signals are now
  searched in 4–5★ reviews and negative ones in 1–2★, pinned by test.

---

## R6 — A command line for the things every category needs

**Status: DONE.** The cheapest item on this roadmap and the best evidenced:
four scripts were written and thrown away in the course of one research
question. Nothing new was needed, only exposing capability that already
existed.

```
shopping_advisor.run reextract <run_dir> [--feed old.jsonl] -o new.jsonl
shopping_advisor.analysis <cmd> feed1.jsonl feed2.jsonl ...   # merge by ASIN
```

Two of the four scripts were built. The other two were not, because they are
partly served under other names: `cards ASIN ASIN` is `card`, which takes more
than one, and a one-axis shortlist is `rank`. **T0 correction:** `rank` does
not reproduce a composite basmati shortlist; its basmati default is price per
kg. The completion measurement below establishes the fusilli one-axis workflow.

**Offline re-extraction was documented in README.md as a code sample** — proof
that it worked, and a sign that it should be a command. It reads the
marketplace and locale from the run's own manifest rather than from a flag,
because re-extracting a German page against an English label vocabulary is
the silent under-extraction R1's locale gate exists for. `--feed` supplies
what a stored page cannot know: which query found the product, where it
ranked, and when it was fetched. Without it search context is absent and
fetch time fell back to filesystem mtime, which is not reliable freshness
evidence after copying a page. T1 removed that fallback: fetch time is
recorded per page when it is fetched, and a run store written before that
reports unknown freshness rather than a filesystem timestamp.

**`fetched_at` is carried across, never refreshed.** A re-extraction stamped
with today's clock would make every old page the freshest evidence in a study
— which is exactly what the merge below is built to believe.

**The analysis CLI took exactly one feed path**, so a three-crawl study needed
a merge-by-ASIN loop the user wrote themselves. Every command now takes as
many feeds as the study has, and the newest `fetched_at` wins — deliberately
*not* the order the feeds were named in. `data/fusilli_*.jsonl` expands
alphabetically, which has nothing to do with when each crawl ran, and price
and availability are precisely the fields an arbitrary argument order would
get wrong. What the merge did heads the report, so a number in it can be
traced back to a crawl.

### Done when

- [x] A finished run re-extracts from shipped commands, with no scratch script.
- [x] Several feeds are one corpus, merged by evidence rather than by argument
      order.
- [x] The fusilli shortlist reproduces from one command line.

### Measured on completion

The fusilli study was reproduced from three local feeds at completion. These
paths are **not committed inputs** in the current repository; use the
[committed-case walkthrough](RESEARCH.md#offline-walkthrough) for onboarding:

```
uv run python -m shopping_advisor.analysis rank \
    data/validation_v3_amazon_de.jsonl data/fusilli_broad.jsonl \
    data/fusilli_brands.jsonl --category dry_pasta
```

| | |
|---|---|
| Records read | 582 from **3 feeds** |
| After merge | **471** — matching the study's own count exactly |
| ASINs crawled more than once | **95**, resolved to their freshest copy |
| Classified dry pasta | **404**, 67 excluded — again the study's own numbers |
| Shortlist products reproducing at the published €/kg | **8 of 9** |
| Offline re-extraction of the broad fusilli run | **224/224 records byte-identical** to what the crawl wrote |

The ninth is Garofalo Fusilli n.63 (`B08JLSVW3J`), and it is not a regression:
its page states 500 g in Amazon's attribute table and 16 × 500 g in the title,
so price per kilogram is `DISPUTED` and the ranking refuses to guess. **The
card already prints both numbers** — "64.98 EUR/kg" beside "if the pack size
stated on the page is right, this is 4.06 EUR/kg" — which is the honest
output. Promoting that derivation to a rankable value is a quantity-
reconciliation decision in the validation layer, and it belongs to R9, not
here. It affected **4 of the 54 fusilli** in the study.

---

## R7 — Attributed search: finding a claim vs crediting it

**Status: DONE.** Two categories independently hit the same bug:
text on an Amazon page is not necessarily *about the product the page sells*.

Measured on basmati: searching every text field for the milling degree marked
**53 of 239** records parboiled and **29 were wrong** — cross-sell copy ("Neben
unseren PURE BASMATI Reis haben wir auch bereits vorgekochte …", which marked
the Stiftung Warentest winner as parboiled), A+ comparison tables listing a
brand's entire shelf, recipe suggestions, and the outright negation
"Non-parboiled for authentic basmati". Restricting to title, ingredient
declaration and attribute rows took it to **0**.

Mounting paste hit the same class of error and solved it positionally, in its
own module. That is the second occurrence R2's promotion rule waits for.

### Scope review (2026-09-15)

At review, the motivating fixes already shipped with category regressions: basmati's
`GRAIN_FIELDS` and `_negated`, mounting paste's `NEGATED` drying exclusions,
and basmati's brand/manufacturer gate for the Tilda/Kajal laboratory result.
The historical 29 errors are not outstanding defects. The combined saved
basmati feed now contains 359 records, of which 239 classify as basmati.

What remained was shared search policy and a real gap in the local fixes:
search selected the first match per field and categories filtered the cropped
quote afterwards. A negated first mention can hide an affirmative one later
in the same field; unrelated negations in the quote can also discard it.

### Scope

- Add `search(..., scope='self' | 'page')` to the validation contract, keeping
  `page` as the compatible default. `self` restricts to title, ingredients
  and raw attribute rows; `fields` further narrows either scope. This is a
  conservative field policy, not proof that every sentence concerns this
  product. Reviews remain a separate search.
- Add opt-in affirmative matching against full-text match positions, before
  quote cropping and result limits. Share bounded German/English prefix
  negations and suffixes such as `mineralölfrei`; preserve affirmative
  absence claims when the pattern itself includes `ohne` or `frei`.
  Category-specific exclusion patterns remain data and reject only overlapping
  matches. Continue through rejected mentions within the same field.
- Migrate basmati milling/declaration checks and mounting-paste claim search.
  Keep mounting-paste prose searchable: restricting its drying evidence to
  `self` would remove legitimate bullets and descriptions. Preserve its
  positional product classifier and kit caveats.
- Retain external laboratory matching in basmati: one consumer does not
  justify a generic external-evidence framework. Test the existing identity
  gate and use literal whole-brand matching with identity evidence attached.

### Explicitly out of scope

General linguistic negation or cross-sell resolution; reattributing all
category claims; changing laboratory findings, scoring policy, acquisition,
marketplace word boundaries or the extraction schema. A brand match does
not establish that a listing's batch or pack was independently tested.

### Done when

- [x] Shared search tests cover scopes, intersecting field filters, negation,
      positive absence claims, later affirmative mentions and quote provenance.
- [x] Both category suites pin the motivating false positives and retained
      true positives, including the external identity gate.
- [x] Offline before/after comparison of saved category feeds accounts for
      every changed card; no known true positive is lost. This is a regression
      check, not a claim of measured classification accuracy.
- [x] The full suite, including extraction/validation snapshots, passes and
      the public search contract documents the boundaries.

### Measured on completion

All **323 tests pass** (296 before R7), including extraction/validation
snapshots, all three categories, and the new `tests/test_attributed_search.py`.
No crawl, dependency upgrade or snapshot regeneration was needed.

Offline comparison covered **1,885 record occurrences across 14 saved files**:

| Saved files | Occurrences | Changed cards |
|---|---:|---:|
| Five `basmati_*.jsonl` feeds (all, brands, broad, and v5 variants) | 1,361 | 61 |
| `paste.jsonl`, `paste_rema.jsonl`, `paste_v2.jsonl`, `paste_v7.jsonl` | 245 | 1 |
| Four archived mounting-paste feeds, v4–v7 | 245 | 1 |
| `tests/cases/mounting_paste_v1.jsonl.gz` | 34 | 1 |

These are overlapping feeds, not distinct products. All **64 changed cards**
only gained evidence; their existing evidence remains intact. The 61 basmati
cards now quote the brand/manufacturer supporting the existing laboratory
attribution. The other three occurrences are `B0BJRG3K8Y`: its A+ text says
`trocknet nicht aus` about storage, then `Abtrocknungsverhalten: langsam
trocknend` about the same Premium white paste. Search now reaches the latter
statement and adds it beside the existing bullet evidence.

Removing evidence arrays from the serialized cards makes the complete
before/after output identical: no changed classification, milling degree,
claim status, laboratory verdict, score, suitability, measured axis or note.
New synthetic regressions separately exercise negated absence claims, later
affirmative mentions, and brand substrings that the saved feeds do not contain.

---

## R8 — Marketplace-aware text matching

**Status: DONE.** The motivating bug was already fixed locally; R8 shares
the boundary policy and makes reporting honest.

### Scope review (2026-09-15)

`basmati_rice.py` already uses `\bbasmati`, and
`test_the_german_compound_noun_is_basmati` protects AKASH, Tilda and Alnatura
titles. The original lost-listing count describes the first implementation,
not the current classifier. Its denominator also differs between the old
roadmap (239) and test commentary (216), so it is not a reproducible current
acceptance measure. The saved `basmati_all.jsonl` now contains **359 records:
239 classified basmati and 120 other products**.

The remaining defect is that the German prefix rule also applies to English
records. `Marketplace` already owns a language and `for_domain()` resolves
profiles, but neither is used by this match. The summary still prints
`0 unclassified` under “Corpus quality”; that measures whether a decision was
made, not whether it was correct.

### Scope

- Add `Marketplace.word(stem)`, returning a regex fragment for a non-empty
  **literal** stem: leading word boundary for German, both boundaries for
  English and other languages. Escape regex metacharacters; callers choose
  case sensitivity. This is an opt-in prefix policy, not a German compound
  parser: exclusions and negations remain the category's responsibility.
- Use it for basmati in both titles and ingredient declarations. Resolve the
  profile per record from `marketplace`, falling back to `product_url` or
  `canonical_url` for legacy feeds and then the existing English fallback.
  Follow the acquisition profile's language; do not infer language from text
  or introduce a new locale override. R1 already gates conflicting crawls.
- Label summary counts as **classification decisions**, with **no decision**
  replacing **unclassified**, and state that accuracy is not measured.

### Explicitly out of scope

A blanket rewrite of category regexes; compound splitting; R7 attribution or
negation work; changes to acquisition locale, extraction schema or marketplace
validation. In particular the provisional `.it` profile is not repaired or
validated by this milestone.

### Done when

- [x] German compounds and standalone English words match; English suffixes
      and embedded stems do not, with literal escaping covered by tests.
- [x] Basmati title and ingredient matching use each record's profile,
      including mixed-marketplace input and legacy URL fallback.
- [x] Every saved German basmati feed retains its complete classification
      output, including evidence and notes; existing category and corpus
      regressions pass.
- [x] Summary tests distinguish decisions from accuracy and cover records
      with no classification decision.

### Measured on completion

All **296 tests pass** (282 before R8), including extraction/validation corpus
snapshots and all three category suites. The compound-title regression now
uses an empty ingredient declaration, so a separate “Basmati Reis” ingredient
cannot hide a broken title match.

Offline before/after comparison of the full classification value, status,
evidence and notes found **zero changes** across all five saved German feeds:

| Feed | Record occurrences | Changed classifications |
|---|---:|---:|
| `basmati_all.jsonl` | 359 | 0 |
| `basmati_brands.jsonl` | 243 | 0 |
| `basmati_brands_v5.jsonl` | 243 | 0 |
| `basmati_broad.jsonl` | 258 | 0 |
| `basmati_broad_v5.jsonl` | 258 | 0 |

The **1,361 occurrences overlap across feeds**, not 1,361 distinct products.
The combined feed remains 239 basmati / 120 other / 0 no decision. English
boundaries are covered by synthetic records, not a newly validated English
marketplace crawl. No new acquisition or snapshot regeneration was needed.

## R9 — A second pass for missing prices

**Status: PLANNED**, behind a decision test.

**73 of 239 basmati (31%) had no purchasable offer at crawl time** — among them
Rapunzel, Spielberger demeter and two Tilda Pure Original pack sizes. R3
measured the same volatility on pasta (195/195 priced in one run, 141/195 in
the next) and correctly concluded the extractor is right to return nothing.

The product consequence was never drawn: **a study built from one crawl
silently omits a third of its category**, and the omission is invisible in the
output.

A second kind of missing price arrived with the fusilli study and belongs
here rather than in R6: **4 of 54 fusilli carry a price per kilogram the page
itself contradicts**, because the seller filled "Anzahl der Einheiten" with
the weight of one pack and Amazon computed its own €/kg from that same wrong
row. Garofalo 16 × 500 g reports €64.98/kg, Barilla n.98 10 × 1 kg reports
€0.37/kg. The card already prints the derivation from the title beside the
contradiction; what is unresolved is whether that derivation may be *ranked
on*, which is a quantity-reconciliation decision in the validation layer and
not a reporting one.

### Decision test, before building anything

Re-fetch the 73 unpriced basmati ASINs once, some hours later, and count how
many price. **Below ~30% recovered**, those listings are genuinely dormant and
an automated second pass is not worth its complexity.

---

## R10 — Scoring as a shared facility

**Status: DEFERRED — deliberately, and the reasoning is the point.**

Basmati needed a composite score; `report.py` refuses to offer one, and its
stated reason is right: a score "could not answer why A is better than B".
Three properties made one defensible anyway, and all three look general:

- every component published with its evidence, never just the total;
- a missing input scores **neutral**, never zero — absence of data is not an
  adverse finding;
- the total is **shrunk toward neutral in proportion to how much is unknown**,
  so a listing whose entire case is its own adjectives cannot outrank one with
  an independent measurement.

The third is not theory. The first draft ranked first a 10 kg bag with **five
ratings** whose feature bullet claimed every heavy metal was below the limit of
detection — a sentence no reader can check, scored as though it were a test
report.

But one category is one data point, and this repository's own experience says
promotion before a second consumer produces bugs dressed as generalisations —
in R2, three of the four things the layer "had to learn" were bugs. Dry pasta
and mounting paste both refuse to score, so there is no second consumer asking.
It stays in `basmati_rice.py`.

---

## R11 — Category synthesis as a default step

**Status: PLANNED.** The largest change in the [vision](#product-vision--the-shopping-conversation),
and the one with the most ways to be quietly wrong.

### Scope

Today three categories ship and the runbook tells the agent to *offer* to
build a fourth. The target is that it builds one, as an ordinary step, for any
product a user asks about — and that the result is honest about being ten
minutes old.

A synthesized category supplies exactly what a written one supplies: a
`CategoryProfile`, a classifier, a list of claims with the reason each
matters, and axes with a declared better direction. Nothing new in the
architecture. What is new is the **provisional** status and what it forbids.

### Why it is not free

- **A category built from one study's brief launders that study's
  constraints into permanent product knowledge.** This is the failure the
  whole repository is shaped around. The generator gets what is true for
  every buyer of the class; the brief keeps the rest. T2's stated-versus-
  defaulted record is what makes the difference auditable afterwards.
- **A shipped category is evidence-backed, and a fresh one is not.** Every
  one of the three was built against real records, and `tests/cases/` asserts
  the false-positive guards as loudly as the true positives — five of the
  pasta records are there *only* because an earlier reconciler disputed them
  wrongly. A category written in one session has none of that, and its
  confidence must not look the same in a report.
- **The quiet half is the plausibility profile.** A wrong classifier is loud:
  the mounting-paste cases come out as `0 dry pasta · 0 offers`. A wrong
  *band* is silent, and measured — 34 mounting-paste records under dry
  pasta's band move 14 values, mostly `trusted` to `disputed`. A generator
  that invents a price band to have one will be wrong in exactly that
  invisible way. The precedent is already in this file: mounting paste ships
  `price_band=None` because "inventing a band to have one would reject real
  listings." **A provisional category should default to no band**, and earn
  one from observed records rather than from a guess.

### Done when

- A category the agent generates is marked provisional, carries the evidence
  and the cases it was derived from, and its study report says which of its
  judgements rest on validated knowledge and which on knowledge invented for
  this question.
- Generated categories go through the same review a written one does before
  losing the provisional mark — `CONTRACT.md` §5 already says a profile is
  data and may not add a rule, and that stays true of a generated one.
- A regression case set exists for at least one generated category, built the
  same way the three shipped ones were: false-positive guards included.

---

## R12 — Discovery that states its own coverage

**Status: PLANNED.** Promoted from [E3](#e3--discovery-coverage-of-the-category),
which has already answered the interesting half of the question.

### Scope

The vision's step 4 says "collect the options the marketplace has". The
honest version of that target is **not** "all" — it is a study that says what
it searched, what it reached, and which class of product it is known to
under-sample.

### Why it is not free: two measurements, both negative

- **Eight generic queries in German and English, two pages each, never
  surfaced AKASH at all.** It took a query naming the brand. AKASH is one of
  only two basmatis Stiftung Warentest rated "gut" in 5/2026 — so a
  researcher who did not already know the answer would not have reached the
  product the study ended up recommending.
- **Thirteen queries across five crawls never surfaced a 50 ml Rema Tip Top
  tin**, because its title is "Rema Tip Top 501004 - Schwammdose,
  Transparent, 50 ml" and contains no word anyone would search for. It is a
  bicycle tyre mounting gel and its title never says so.

Neither is fixed by crawling deeper; the broad sweep already went two pages
per query. E3's sharper finding is that generic queries systematically
under-sample **diaspora brands**, which on Amazon.de are a large share of the
real shelf in exactly the categories where they matter — rice, pulses,
spices, flour. That is query design, not crawl depth.

### Done when

- A brand-expansion pass, seeded from the first crawl's own `brand` field, is
  a bounded and measured step rather than something a researcher remembers.
- A study report states its discovery coverage as a fact: which queries ran,
  what they returned, which products arrived only through a named-ASIN or
  brand-expansion path, and what the method is known not to reach.
- E3's threshold decides the priority: brand-only-discovered products taking
  more than ~20% of a shortlist. On basmati it was **1 of 8 finalists, and 2
  of the 3 products with external laboratory evidence** — above the bar on
  the measure that matters.

---

## R13 — The conversation as the entry point

**Status: PLANNED.** Depends on nothing technical; depends on R11 to be
useful for a product nobody wrote a category for.

### Scope

Steps 1 and 2 of the vision exist today as a *runbook an agent follows*:
[Agree the brief](RESEARCH.md#agree-the-brief) has the blocking/assumable
test, the batched round, the read-back before collection. T2 made the output
of that conversation a validated artifact. What does not exist is the flow —
a user describing a purchase and getting a study, without anybody reading
`RESEARCH.md` first.

### Why it is not free

The brief must still be **written down and agreed**. The conversation is how
it gets filled in, not a replacement for it: an unrecorded requirement change
is indistinguishable from a result, and that sentence is in the runbook
because the alternative was tried. A flow that elicits requirements and keeps
them only in the dialogue would undo T2.

The second trap is the questionnaire. The runbook's rule — block only on what
would make the work wrong under every plausible answer, assume the rest with
a stated default — is a product decision, not an implementation detail. A
flow that asks ten questions to feel thorough is worse than the CLI.

### Done when

- A user who has read nothing can describe a purchase and receive either a
  study bundle or a stated reason there is none.
- Every question asked is recorded in the brief with its answer or the
  default taken, and the report shows what would change if a default were
  wrong — the runbook's closing step already asks which questions actually
  decided the answer, and this is what makes that measurable.

---

## R14 — A recommendation in a category nobody validated

**Status: PLANNED. Needs R10 and R11.**

### Scope

Step 5 of the vision, for the case that makes it hard. Recommending within a
shipped category is done: name an axis, rank it, state the exclusions, refuse
where the evidence will not carry. A category synthesized this morning has no
validated axis worth declaring, and "cheapest per kilogram" is a dry-pasta
answer that means nothing for a vacuum cleaner.

### Why it is not free, and what it unblocks

This is the second consumer R10 has been waiting for. R10 is deferred for a
good reason — one category is one data point, and in R2 three of the four
things the layer "had to learn" turned out to be bugs — but a generator that
produces categories *is* a second consumer, and an open-ended one.

The three properties R10 already established are the safeguards, and they
matter more here, not less:

- every component published with its evidence, never just the total;
- a missing input scores **neutral**, never zero;
- the total shrunk toward neutral in proportion to how much is unknown.

The third is the one that stops a synthesized category from recommending a
listing whose entire case is its own adjectives. R10's own worked failure —
a 10 kg bag with five ratings, ranked first on a feature bullet claiming
every heavy metal was below the limit of detection — is precisely what an
unvalidated category will produce by default.

### Done when

- A recommendation from a provisional category is reproducible, states the
  weights it used and where they came from, and is visibly less confident
  than one from a validated category.
- `insufficient_evidence` remains reachable and is reached: a generator that
  can always find something to recommend has replaced judgement with output.

## Deferred and rejected work

| Capability | Decision | Reconsider when |
|---|---|---|
| Browser automation (Playwright, Selenium) | **REJECTED** | `amazon/challenge/*` becomes non-zero at a meaningful rate, or a field with demonstrated product value is found to exist only after JS execution. Today: 201/201 HTTP 200, zero challenges; the one client-loaded structure found duplicates server-rendered data. |
| Proxy rotation, fingerprinting | **REJECTED** | Sustained 429/503 on **PDP** requests under current pacing. The measured 503s were a `/s?` burst artifact, fixed by sequential search pacing. |
| OCR of product / A+ images | **DROPPED** | A named product question is blocked by image-only data. Measured: 0 of 60 bronze-die and 0 of 50 Gragnano claims are A+-image-only. Justifying evidence would be ≥20 records where a **V1 axis** is `unknown` and the value is visible only inside an image. |
| Reviews | **DONE → R5** | Decision test passed at 57% against a 30% bar. Cost a tenth of the estimate: the data is in the retained PDP HTML, and the larger version is unavailable — `/product-reviews/` needs an account. |
| Amazon.com completion | **DEFERRED → R4** | A stated user need for US research. |
| Framework / runtime upgrade | **DEFERRED (maintenance)** | A product goal is blocked by the runtime. The last upgrade silently dropped an attribute table from two corpus pages; the corpus test is the gate. Never mix an upgrade with product work. |
| `amazon_search.py` | **REMOVED in T0** | No supported code/test consumer found in the tracked-reference inventory. Use `amazon_product`; see the [migration note](README.md#legacy-search-spider-migration) for its different feed shape and acquisition scope. |
| Nutrition coverage beyond validation | **DEFERRED** | Never as a coverage goal. 44% is Amazon's ceiling, not the parser's. |

---

## Product boundaries

| Boundary | Decision |
|---|---|
| Generic extraction | **Correct as is.** No pasta logic in the parser; all fourteen measured pasta signals are recoverable from `raw_tables`, `content.*` and `food.ingredients`. Do not trade "raw first, normalized second" for coverage. |
| Food extraction | **Correct placement**, one change: the food layer must stop asserting values it cannot defend. |
| Validation | **Two layers, never inside extraction** — shipped in R2 as `shopping_advisor/validation/`, published as [CONTRACT.md](CONTRACT.md). Extraction stays faithful to the source. *Generic:* unit-versus-field disagreement, basis-phrase-as-value, mass balance, Atwater, single-nutrient corroboration, quantity-versus-price coherence, on-page source conflict. *Category:* plausibility bands, claim/ingredient contradictions, price floors — supplied to the generic layer as **data**, never as procedure. |
| Category analysis | **Downstream of the JSONL.** The acquisition layer never learns what good pasta is. Confirmed by a second category in R2: tyre mounting paste needed no change to the crawler, the extractor, or any trust rule — only a profile, a classifier and a list of claims. **This boundary survives [R11](#r11--category-synthesis-as-a-default-step):** a category the agent writes is the same four things in the same place, so synthesis is a question about where category knowledge *comes from*, never about where it sits. |
| Who writes a category | **Changing, deliberately — see [R11](#r11--category-synthesis-as-a-default-step).** Today a human writes one as a reviewed maintenance change, and the runbook offers that as a choice. The target is that the agent writes one by default, marked provisional, carrying its evidence, and unable to look as confident as a validated one. The boundary that replaces "a human wrote it" is **validated versus provisional**, and it has to be visible in the report rather than implied by the absence of a warning. |
| Marketplace-specific | `shared structural extraction + marketplace profile + adapters where measured evidence demands`. Correct, but currently over-applied: two profiles exist that nobody validated. |
| Discovery / Product | **Separate the record now (R1), defer the entity (R3).** The requirement is that a repeat sighting must not cost a repeat fetch and must not be erased. |
| Locale | **Record it, do not abstract it.** Justification is correctness: the request locale and the label vocabulary are chosen independently today and can disagree with no error at all. German stays the authoritative Amazon.de discovery locale. |

## Open experiments

Questions the repository cannot currently answer. Each blocks a specific
decision; none blocks R0.

### E1 — True package-quantity error rate

- **Blocks:** whether price per kg can remain V1's primary axis.
- **Why unresolved:** conflict detection needs an independent pack hint. After
  R0, 100 of 161 dry-pasta records carry one (88 corroborated, 12 disputed);
  the other 61 are unverified or unknown and could hide errors of the same
  kind. The 12 found are a floor, not the rate.
- **Experiment:** hand-verify extracted total quantity against the live PDP
  for a random 30 of the 163 records. Half a day, no crawl changes.
- **Threshold:** >15% wrong or unresolvable → price per kg cannot be a trusted
  axis; V1 leads with raw material and claim evidence, and R3 is pulled
  forward.

### E2 — Cross-query discovery overlap — **RESOLVED**

**43 of 213 sightings (20%) are repeats**, against a threshold of 10%. The
earlier position-gap estimate was too low, because it could only see
cross-query repeats and missed the larger source: the same ASIN listed twice
on one page, once organic and once sponsored.

Over the threshold, so the persistence split moved into R1 and is done —
occurrences live in `discovery.jsonl` and are never collapsed, products live
in the feed. What stays in R3 is the part with no consumer yet: a model that
*joins* them, and offer families. The reasoning is the same one that put R0
before R2 — do not model what nothing reads.

### E3 — Discovery coverage of the category

- **Blocks:** whether query design becomes a roadmap item of its own.
- **Sharpened by R2.** On the mounting-paste crawl, 47 of 90 results were not
  the product searched for, and the *criterion that decides the purchase* is
  stated on 3 of the 43 that were. Whether that is a discovery problem (the
  right products exist and these queries do not surface them) or a category
  ceiling (Amazon listings simply do not say) is now the more interesting
  version of this question, and it is answerable with a hand check.
- **Answered in part by R5's category, and the answer is "discovery".** Eight
  generic queries in German and English, two result pages each, **never
  surfaced AKASH at all** — the brand took a query naming it. AKASH
  Basmatireis is one of only two basmatis Stiftung Warentest rated "gut" in
  5/2026. A researcher who did not already know that result would not have
  reached the product it recommends.
- **The sharper question now:** generic queries systematically under-sample
  **diaspora brands**, which on Amazon.de are a large share of the real shelf
  in exactly the categories where they matter — rice, pulses, spices, flour.
  That is a query-design problem and it is not solved by crawling deeper: the
  broad sweep already went two pages deep per query.
- **Experiment:** for a category, take the brands that only brand-specific
  queries discovered, and measure their share of the final shortlist. On
  basmati: **1 of 8 finalists, and 2 of the 3 products with external
  laboratory evidence.**
- **Threshold:** brand-only-discovered products taking more than ~20% of a
  shortlist → query design becomes a roadmap item, most likely as a
  brand-expansion pass seeded from the first crawl's own brand field.
- **Crossed, and promoted to [R12](#r12--discovery-that-states-its-own-coverage)
  (2026-09-16).** The basmati measure is above the bar, and the
  [product vision](#product-vision--the-shopping-conversation) makes coverage
  load-bearing rather than incidental: a flow that promises to collect the
  options a marketplace has must be able to say which ones it cannot reach.

### E4 — Does the trust bar leave enough to compare?

- **Blocks:** the framing of V1 itself.
- **Experiment:** measured inside R0 — count products with at least one
  trusted comparison axis.
- **Threshold:** <60 of 163 comparable → V1 reframes to "here is what Amazon
  does and does not tell you about these products", and evidence-gap
  reporting becomes the user-visible feature.

## Superseded hypothesis (P0–P6)

Kept for the reasoning, not as a plan.

| Item | Verdict | Became | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0 stabilise generic extraction contract | **CHANGE** | R2 | Already pinned by `SCHEMA_VERSION`, the schema table in EXTRACTION.md and the 35-page corpus test. What was missing is a consumer. Freezing first would have ratified `confidence` semantics that measurement shows are inverted. |
| P1 improve discovery/product modelling | **SPLIT** | R1 (additive provenance) / R3 (entity separation) | Recording occurrences is cheap and irreversible if skipped. Promoting them to separate entities is a storage decision with no consumer demanding it. |
| P2 add validation / trust layer | **MERGE** | R0 (axis-specific) + R2 (generic) | Validation is a precondition for an honest first ranking, but a general framework with no consumer repeats P0's mistake. |
| P3 build dry-pasta analysis | **MOVE_EARLIER** | R0 | The only item producing user value, and it needs no crawl. |
| P4 product variations / twisters | **SPLIT** | R1 (raw capture) / R3 (family modelling) | The twister blob is validation evidence first and a grouping feature second. |
| P5 validate / complete Amazon.com | **DEFER** | R4 | No product need; `.de` has produced no user-facing output yet, and the unvalidated `.co.uk`/`.it` profiles are already the debt this creates. |
| P6 optional enrichment (OCR, reviews) | **SPLIT** | OCR dropped / reviews R5 | A+ content contributes zero unique evidence for V1's top claims. |

### T3 — DONE (2026-09-16): external evidence and recommendation audits

- Ledger v1 retains source metadata, permitted text/digests or explicit access
  limits, product/batch identity, matching evidence, conflicts and supersession.
  Indexed claims enforce historical/current-batch/vendor/sample/access scopes.
  Three basmati executable constants are now `legacy_unverified` ledger entries;
  missing original URLs/documents remain missing. No real source was newly
  accessed or verified in this maintenance change.
- Study manifest v2 adds ledger, claim index, deterministic validation and a
  separately completed semantic review. Full replay now checks ranking order,
  exclusions, constraints, freshness, every card/score and exact report bytes.
  Reviews bind both report and evidence/decision digests, record findings and
  unresolved limits, and distinguish pending from approval. `validate-report`
  emits JSON; `--require-review` additionally requires semantic approval.
- Adopted method: existing single-axis ranking, normally EUR/kg. No score-based
  shortlist or external-evidence-driven price eligibility is introduced.
  Basmati score method v2 removes unverified laboratory credit and unsupported
  safety bonuses from milling/origin/vendor assertions. Its starting health
  value is neutral, and existing adverse review adjustments remain heuristics.
- Measured effect on the three synthetic basmati fixtures (same pinned product
  inputs evaluated with HEAD before T3 and the new module):

  | Fixture brand | External status before → after | Total score before → after | Health before → after |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Tilda | trusted → unverified | 60.5 → 54.5 | 0.9 → 0.5 |
  | Akash | trusted → unverified | 60.0 → 54.1 | 0.9 → 0.5 |
  | Gepa | trusted → unverified | 40.2 → 53.7 | 0.0 → 0.5 |

  The old health lookup also assigned Akash Tilda's 0.9 by selecting the first
  matching verdict. Removing unverifiable credit removes that false precision.
  These are software fixture measurements, not product ratings or buying advice.
  Price order remains 3, 4, 5 EUR/kg. A separate regression changes the third
  price to 2.5 EUR/kg and reproduces its move to first place.
- Two complete [basmati examples](tests/studies/t3/README.md) include sanitized
  synthetic records, retained synthetic source text and separate semantic review
  findings. The positive example selects B000000001, 33.3% ahead on listed
  EUR/kg; the second requires four candidates, finds three and recommends none.
  Both pass `validate-report --require-review`. Existing pasta examples retain
  their decisions; manifest v2 gives the positive example the new ID
  `pasta-bronze-die-46127870314d` (the T2 IDs above are historical).
- Verification: locked setup, **460 offline tests passed** (27 added for T3),
  no extraction/generic validation snapshot updates. Covered wrong reseller,
  variant, marketplace and batch; conflicts, supersession, absent/fabricated
  support, stale/future dates, vendor overreach, sampled-review population claims,
  digest tampering, rehashed score/rank/claim changes and semantic-review binding.
- Limits: automated checks establish reproducibility and declared applicability,
  not semantic truth. The real legacy sources remain access-limited. Real buying
  advice requires fresh acquisition and source review. Provider interchangeability
  trials and automated maintenance gates remain T4.
