"""What a category analyzer is, and the little it has to declare.

A category is the only place in the platform that is allowed to know what the
product is. It declares four things and implements one:

``profile``
    The plausibility data the generic layer needs -- nutrition bands, a price
    band -- and nothing procedural. See
    :class:`~amazon_scraper.validation.CategoryProfile`.

``axes``
    What it is worth comparing two of these products on, in order, and which
    direction is better. This is a *product* decision and it is not the same
    for every category: cheaper per kilogram is the point of dry pasta, and
    actively misleading for tyre mounting paste, where a five-kilogram tub is
    the worst buy on the page for somebody with one scooter tyre to fit.

``claims``
    The statements worth hunting for in the vendor's own text, each with the
    reason it matters. A claim may be *adverse* -- finding it is bad news.

``evaluate``
    ``record -> card``. Classification, the axes filled in, and the claims
    searched for. Everything it needs about trust it gets from
    :func:`amazon_scraper.validation.validate`; it must not re-derive any of
    it, and there is a test that asserts exactly that.
