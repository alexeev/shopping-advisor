"""Tyre mounting paste: the second category, and the one that tested the contract.

The use case is specific and it is not a grocery one. A 10-inch pneumatic
scooter tyre with an inner tube has to go onto an aluminium rim by hand, and
three properties decide whether a paste is the right one:

1. **It must dry after mounting and stop lubricating.** A paste that stays
   slippery lets the tyre creep on the rim, which shears the valve off the
   tube. This is the criterion that matters most, and the hardest to read off
   a product page -- 14 of 43 listings state it, and the first version of this
   module found only 3, because it looked for the verb ("trocknet ab") and
   German marketing copy prefers the adjective ("schnelltrocknend"). The
   correction is in the ``dries_out`` pattern below, and the three records
   that forced it are in the test corpus.
2. **It must be safe on rubber**, and free of mineral oil and aggressive
   solvents -- both attack the tube as well as the tyre.
3. **It should inhibit corrosion**, or at least be declared safe on aluminium
   rims.

And the economics invert. Pack size is not a discount axis here: one scooter
tyre needs a few grams, the shelf is dominated by five-kilogram workshop tubs,
and the cheapest paste per kilogram on the page is the worst buy for this
user. So the ranking axis is *pack size, smallest first*, and price per
kilogram is computed, shown, and explicitly refused as a ranking.

What this category proved about the generic layer is written up in CONTRACT.md
§"What the second category changed". The short version: every trust rule
transferred unchanged, the one thing the layer had to learn was that a pack
measured in millilitres reconciles to a price per litre, and a real bug fell
out -- four records here state "Fett" (German for grease *and* for fat) beside
a pack size, which the food parser read as a nutrition declaration and the
generic layer would have trusted, because nothing in it required a nutrition
value to be corroborated by a second one.
