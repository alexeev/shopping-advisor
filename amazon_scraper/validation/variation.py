"""Reading Amazon's variation matrix: which ASINs are the same product.

The crawler stores the twister blob verbatim and interprets nothing (R1). This
is the interpretation, and it is deliberately thin: identify the family an ASIN
belongs to, and pull out the one dimension value that means a pack size.

Two things make that worth doing, and the first is smaller than it looks.

**Comparison.** When search returns two listings of one product in different
boxes, ranking them as rivals is wrong twice over: it doubles a producer's
apparent presence, and it implies a quality difference where only the pack
differs. Measured on a three-query Amazon.de crawl this is uncommon -- a
handful of offers out of a couple of hundred listings -- because most families
surface once. It is worth handling anyway, because when it does happen the
answer is interesting: the same pasta turned up in two listings priced 29%
apart per kilo, and a five-pack that costs *more* per kilo than the single box
beside it.

**Quantity.** The more reliable payoff. The size dimension is an independent
statement of what is in the pack, from a different structure than the
attribute table that gets pack sizes wrong -- and it is sometimes the only
pack size on the page, because ``Paketgröße - Name`` is empty.

Note that the extraction corpus overstates how common the matrix is. Those
pages were chosen for layout diversity, so 24 of 34 carry one; on records from
an ordinary search crawl it is closer to one in five.

What it does *not* do is guess. The matrix names its own dimensions, so the
size dimension is looked up rather than inferred: a product whose only
dimension is ``color_name`` yields no quantity, and "Roségold" is never parsed
as a weight.
