"""The contract between extraction and category analysis.

One call, :func:`validate`, turns an extraction record into a
:class:`Validated` record: the same facts, each carrying how it was obtained
and whether it survived checking. A category analyzer starts there and adds
only what it alone knows -- what the product *is*, which claims matter, and
which numbers are plausible for it. It never re-derives a trust rule, and it
never has to know the order the generic rules run in.

That order is the part worth having in one place. It is not obvious and it was
learned the expensive way::

    detect  ->  category bands  ->  resolve contradictions  ->  promote

A generic check can prove that an energy figure and its own macronutrients
contradict each other, but not which side is wrong; a plausibility band can
say which value is impossible, but only for a named category. So the bands
have to run in the middle, and *nothing* may be promoted to trusted until both
have spoken. When this sequence lived in the pasta module, the pasta module
was the specification, and a second category would have had to copy four lines
of ordering it had no way to know were load-bearing.

What a category supplies is data, not procedure: a :class:`CategoryProfile`
of plausibility bands. Two categories now share this layer -- dry pasta
(food, sold by weight, cheaper per kilogram is better) and tyre mounting
paste (non-food, no nutrition at all, sold in tubs and tubes, where a *small*
pack is the advantage and price per kilogram is actively misleading). What
survived contact with the second one is recorded in CONTRACT.md.
