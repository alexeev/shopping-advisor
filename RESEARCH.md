# Product research runbook

This is the current workflow for the shipped tools. Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)
first. T0 makes the existing workflow discoverable and T1 makes acquisition and
replay trustworthy; structured study artifacts and automated report validation
in the [transition plan](AGENT_TRANSITION_PLAN.md) are not implemented yet.

## Offline walkthrough

After [setup and shell configuration](README.md#setup-and-first-check), run the
following commands from the repository root. Each is a single line that works
in PowerShell or a POSIX shell. `--offline` prevents uv downloads; these analysis
commands themselves only read local feeds and perform no network requests.

**Example question:** Among the dry pastas in the committed case set, which
have a usable price per kilogram, and what makes a comparison defensible?
This demonstrates evidence handling, not current buying advice or exhaustive
market discovery. The feed deliberately includes known defects and controls.

### 1. Inspect quality and exclusions

```text
uv run --offline --locked python -m amazon_scraper.analysis summary tests/cases/pasta_v1.jsonl.gz --category dry_pasta
```

Expect a provenance line reading 25 records from one feed on `amazon.de`, then
25 records, 22 classified as dry pasta, three other products, and no
undecided classification. The summary explicitly says accuracy is not measured:
a wrong rejection could still be a confident decision. Inspect the status
counts rather than treating a populated numeric field as usable.

### 2. Rank on the declared axis

```text
uv run --offline --locked python -m amazon_scraper.analysis rank tests/cases/pasta_v1.jsonl.gz --category dry_pasta --limit 3
```

Expect price-per-kg ranking, 14 offers with a trusted ranking value, and eight
excluded records. The first result is `B0CT3Q17FP` at the historical fixture
price of 1.58 EUR/kg. This establishes cheapest within these rankable fixture
records; it does not establish best pasta for a user or a currently purchasable
offer. Read the exclusion reasons below the ranking.

### 3. Inspect a card and its evidence

```text
uv run --offline --locked python -m amazon_scraper.analysis card tests/cases/pasta_v1.jsonl.gz B08WJGD5Z5 --category dry_pasta
```

Locate the quantity, price-per-kg value, statuses, and source quotations.
For this category the same card can be inspected as JSON:

```text
uv run --offline --locked python -m amazon_scraper.analysis card tests/cases/pasta_v1.jsonl.gz B08WJGD5Z5 --category dry_pasta --json
```

The provenance summary goes to stderr and JSON goes to stdout. A single
`card --json` is a pretty-printed object; use `cards --json` for JSONL across
category matches. Do not generalize this example's JSON completeness to basmati.

### 4. Compare two usable products

```text
uv run --offline --locked python -m amazon_scraper.analysis compare tests/cases/pasta_v1.jsonl.gz B08WJGD5Z5 B0DQ2N5HRW --category dry_pasta
```

Expect a `Differences` section including the cheaper-per-kilogram comparison.
Read the individual axes and caveats before turning that into purchase advice.

### 5. Exercise a refusal

```text
uv run --offline --locked python -m amazon_scraper.analysis compare tests/cases/pasta_v1.jsonl.gz B08JLSVW3J B08WJGD5Z5 --category dry_pasta
```

Expect `Price per kg` under `Cannot be compared`: the first product's pack
quantity is disputed. The card can show an alternative calculation without
promoting it to a trusted ranking value. Do not remove the contradiction to
force a comparison.

### 6. Inspect the underlying validation

```text
uv run --offline --locked python -m amazon_scraper.analysis validated tests/cases/pasta_v1.jsonl.gz --category dry_pasta
```

Expect 25 JSONL records with `contract_version: 2` and
`category_profile: "dry_pasta"`. This command applies the selected category's
plausibility bands; it does not run its classifier/claim evaluator. For neutral
validation, use the Python API `validate(record)` without a profile. There is
no neutral CLI option.

### 7. Locate the evidence and explain the result

- The input is [tests/cases/pasta_v1.jsonl.gz](tests/cases/pasta_v1.jsonl.gz);
  [its README](tests/cases/README.md) explains why the named products were chosen.
- Cards identify record fields and quote the supporting text. Raw fields remain
  in the source JSONL; validated outputs do not retain every raw field.
- The separate [saved-page corpus](tests/corpus/README.md) tests extraction and
  neutral validation. Not every case-feed product has a saved HTML fixture.
- [data/evidence/README.md](data/evidence/README.md) describes larger committed
  historical crawls; these are not a complete archive of every study.

A defensible example conclusion distinguishes the lowest usable historical
price from a suitability recommendation, explains the disputed pack exclusion,
and labels the dataset as selected regression cases. No fresh crawl is needed
to answer this offline question.

## Live research workflow

### Record the brief and working notes

Create a dated working note under `reports/` before collection. There is no
enforced brief schema yet; include:

- Question/use case, category, marketplace and delivery region.
- Hard requirements versus preferences, budget/cost basis, and unacceptable
  alternatives. Record what evidence would establish each decisive requirement.
- Freshness needed for price, availability, and other time-sensitive claims.
- Known ASINs, planned generic/brand queries, external sources, and why chosen.
- Query/page/product/time limits, assumptions, and material unresolved questions.

Ask for missing information when it materially changes the recommendation.
Keep existing user authorization; do not ask again merely because this runbook
exists. An unsupported category requires scoped category development and tests
before its judgments become a supported method.

### Live collection

Inspect existing feeds/pages first. Fresh prices require a new observation;
new parser fields can often be obtained by re-extraction. Keep the default
profile's pacing and the encoding variable from README. Choose a new output
path for every run; the example path below must not already contain evidence
you need.

The proxy-free profile is the default since T1, so no profile variable is
needed. `SCRAPY_PROJECT=baseline` still selects the same profile if a written
command already sets it. Both shells run the same line:

```text
uv run --offline --locked scrapy crawl amazon_product -a keyword="spaghetti hartweizen" -a domain="www.amazon.de" -a max_pages=1 -a max_products_per_query=5 -s CLOSESPIDER_TIMEOUT=180 -O data/research-example-01.jsonl
```

Here **`--offline` applies to uv, not the crawler**: Scrapy makes marketplace
requests. `CLOSESPIDER_TIMEOUT` bounds crawl duration, but in-flight requests
can take time to finish; timeout closure means partial results. The product cap
bounds discovery, not retries or the exact number of HTTP requests. The baseline
uses concurrency 1, configured delay 9 seconds with jitter/AutoThrottle, and two
retries. Keep page retention enabled and run crawls sequentially.

For a named product, replace the `keyword` argument with `-a asin="B086BX8M3C"`
and choose another output path. Several queries or ASINs use semicolon-separated
strings. An ASIN-only run does not perform the default pasta search. Named
products matter: search can miss a relevant product even across brand queries.

Record the logged run ID and the feed path together; the manifest also names
the feed the crawl was told to write. Read the run back with:

```text
uv run --offline --locked python -m amazon_scraper.run inspect data/runs/ACTUAL_RUN_ID
```

It reports the run state (`complete`, `interrupted`, or `legacy` for a store
written before T1), the code revision and settings profile that produced the
evidence, challenge/HTTP/parse counters, retained failure samples, and any
quarantined pages. A run that never closed its manifest is `interrupted`: its
coverage is partial regardless of how many records the feed holds.

Inspect `discovery.jsonl` to distinguish never-sighted products from repeated
sightings, and `pages.jsonl` for each retained page's fetch time, URLs, status
and stored-bytes digest. Direct ASIN seeds do not appear as search sightings;
their feed `search_query` is `asin:<ASIN>` and the arguments are in the
manifest. Add `-a keep_search_pages=1` when the study needs to show what a
query returned; it is off by default because search pages are large.

Challenge pages and titleless responses are retained as bounded, truncated
samples under `failures/`, capped per reason. A page whose redaction failed is
kept under `quarantine/`: it is still evidence and still re-extracts, but it
must not be exported or promoted into the corpus.

A `finished` crawl or HTTP 200 response does not prove adequate research
coverage. If challenges or failures leave decisive gaps, record them, stop
repeated collection, and use a bounded later attempt or a qualified answer.
Do not fix a source absence by changing trust rules.

### Re-extract and analyze

For a retained run, replace these paths with the actual run directory, original
feed, and a new destination. The command works in either shell:

```text
uv run --offline --locked python -m amazon_scraper.run reextract data/runs/ACTUAL_RUN_ID --feed data/research-example-01.jsonl -o data/research-example-01-reextracted.jsonl
```

Supply the original feed so the discovery lineage — which query found the
product, and at which position — survives. Fetch time comes from the run's own
page index and survives the bundle being copied; a run store written before T1
has no index, and its replayed records then carry `fetched_at: null` with
`fetched_at_source: "unknown"` rather than a filesystem timestamp. Treat those
as unknown freshness. Keep original feeds unchanged.

Replay refuses a feed that belongs to another crawl or another marketplace,
and reports a page whose stored bytes no longer match the digest the run
recorded. A replayed record carries `extracted_at`, which is how a merge tells
a new reading of old bytes from a new observation.

Use the walkthrough's analysis commands with your feed and explicit category.
Multiple feeds go in the positional list. Merging keys on marketplace and ASIN,
so a mixed set no longer loses records — but an analysis still covers one
marketplace, and the command stops until `--marketplace` names one. A newer
record without a price must not be silently replaced with an old priced record
in the recommendation.

Read cards for known candidates, excluded candidates, and the shortlist.
`summary` counts classifier decisions, not accuracy. Compare units, variants,
pack sizes and cost assumptions before preferring a ranking row. `rank` does
not enforce a complete user brief: it orders one axis, in one unit, and states
the exclusions. It refuses an axis with no declared better direction, and asks
for `--unit` when the axis is measured in more than one — name the unit the
use case actually needs rather than taking the larger group. `compare` refuses
incompatible units and can expose the limitation.

### Check external evidence and write the report

Read manufacturer specifications, independent tests, or other relevant sources
when the question needs facts absent from Amazon. Record URL, title/publisher,
publication and access dates, the exact supporting location, product/variant
identity, and limits. Preserve a permitted source/excerpt locally where useful.
Distinguish a vendor declaration from a measured property and a historical test
from evidence about the current batch. Unavailable sources remain unverified.

Basmati's embedded external-test constants lack complete source provenance and
applicability controls. Its text cards show its seven-part score, but `rank`
still sorts price per kilogram and JSON omits material basmati extras. Do not
claim that the CLI reproduces a composite shortlist or that an embedded
`trusted` external match establishes current product safety.

Follow [reports/README.md](reports/README.md) for output conventions. Include the
question, as-of dates, recommendation/alternatives, suitability and tradeoffs,
comparison values, exclusions, sources per material claim, and unresolved gaps.
Record exact feed paths, run IDs, commands/options and relevant code revision in
the working note. Assess freshness and delivered cost explicitly; absent
shipping data is unknown, not zero.

Before delivery, check that decisive numeric values are usable, units/currency
agree, citations support the selected variant and claim, sample reviews are
not used for rates, and conclusions say “among sources/products inspected”
where coverage is limited. Record the checks and remaining uncertainty.
There is no automated report validator today. An honest insufficient-evidence
answer is a valid result.

### Close and capture improvements

Keep working notes and reports at explicit locations and tell the user where
they are. `reports/` and most of `data/` are gitignored; this is not a backup or
portable study archive. Do not claim that another checkout can reproduce a
report unless its inputs are available there.

Record discoveries with source/run/ASIN, observed versus expected behavior,
reproduction command, affected layer and proposed next action. Follow
[the maintenance workflow](AGENTS.md#maintenance-workflow) for a code change.
Promote verified behavior to code/tests and useful procedure to the runbook;
leave speculative improvements as dated proposals. Keep the study's original
evidence and explain any changed analysis after a fix.

## Current limitations

| Limitation | What to do now | Planned stage |
|---|---|---|
| One analysis covers one marketplace; cross-marketplace comparison is unsupported | Name the marketplace with `--marketplace` and report only that shelf | R4/T5 |
| Evidence collected before T1 has no page digests, recorded fetch times or feed bindings | `inspect` reports such a run as `legacy`; label its freshness unknown rather than inferring it | — (historical data) |
| Feeds are bound by the run id on their records, not by a digest taken at close | Keep original feeds unchanged and record their paths; a merged multi-run feed reports `mixed` lineage | T2 |
| Failure capture is bounded, and search pages are retained only on request | Read the capped counters in the manifest; re-collect with `keep_search_pages=1` when discovery itself is in question | — (by design) |
| A quarantined page is evidence but not exportable | Re-extract it if needed; never promote it into the corpus or attach it to a report | — (by design) |
| No structured study brief, complete category JSON, or report checks | Keep explicit working notes and perform documented manual verification | T2/T3 |
| Original full studies/reports and basmati source documents are not all tracked | Use the committed walkthrough for onboarding; request/rebuild missing evidence only when the task needs it | T2/T3 |
| No two-provider acceptance trial yet | Load the same canonical instructions; do not claim proven provider handoff | T4 |

## Failure diagnosis

| Symptom | First evidence to inspect |
|---|---|
| Setup/profile/locale failure | README troubleshooting, `scrapy.cfg`, current shell variables, `settings.py` |
| Challenge, failed download or missing candidates | `run inspect`, the manifest stats, retained `failures/` samples, discovery occurrences, planned queries/ASINs |
| A crawl that stopped without a summary | `run inspect`: an `interrupted` state means the manifest never closed and coverage is partial |
| Missing or wrong extracted field | `extraction.errors`, raw content/tables, retained page; reproduce with `reextract` |
| A replay that refuses a feed or a page | The feed belongs to another crawl/marketplace, or the stored bytes no longer match the run's recorded digest |
| Disputed number | Evidence card and source fields, quantity/price units, category profile |
| Expected product classified out | Title, ingredients/body, the category classifier and existing cases |
| Test snapshot mismatch | Field-level diff and saved page; explain the change before updating any expected output |

Do not recrawl just to reproduce a parser error whose page is already retained.
If the required evidence was never retained, record that limitation explicitly.
