"""Regression test over saved real Amazon pages: extraction, then validation.

`tests/corpus/` holds the pages the extraction layer was built against, one
gzipped HTML file per ASIN, grouped by marketplace, next to two snapshots:

`expected.jsonl.gz`
    the record each page should extract to -- what the page says.
`validated.jsonl.gz`
    the contract record each of those should validate to, with **no category
    profile** -- how much of what the page says holds up on its own.

Both are compared field by field. The second exists because the published
contract is now something downstream code depends on, and a change in a
status, a source or a note is exactly as much of a breaking change as a
change in an extracted value -- and far easier to make by accident, because
the validation rules interact. It is deliberately run without a category:
what is pinned is the layer that belongs to nobody.

This is the test the unit tests cannot be: the fixtures in
`test_extraction.py` are hand-written and pin down structures we already
understand, while these are 2 MB pages full of structures nobody enumerated.
A runtime upgrade once silently dropped an attribute table from two of them
and no unit test noticed.

When a change is *meant* to alter either output, regenerate the snapshots and
review the diff as part of the change:
