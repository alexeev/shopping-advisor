"""Amazon search -> pagination -> product detail page crawler.

The crawl flow -- search, pagination, ASIN discovery, de-duplication, challenge
detection, pacing -- is unchanged from the validated baseline. Two layers were
added around it without touching it.

PDP parsing delegates to :mod:`shopping_advisor.extraction`, which returns a rich
record and reports per block whether the data was present, absent or failed to
parse.

Everything a crawl knows about itself now survives it (:mod:`shopping_advisor.run`):
the run's identity and locale travel on every record, every sighting is written
down *before* de-duplication can discard it, and the page each record came from
is kept -- with the time it was fetched, the URLs it came from and the digest of
the bytes stored -- so a later extractor never has to ask Amazon twice.

What a crawl *fails* to get survives it too. A challenge page and a 200 with no
product title are still counted in the stats and still produce no record, but a
bounded, truncated, redacted sample of each is now retained, because "48
records from 56 requests" with nothing underneath it cannot be reproduced
without crawling the shelf again. Search responses are retained only when the
run is asked for them: they are the only witness to what a query returned, and
the largest thing a crawl downloads.

    ``keyword`` accepts several queries separated by ``;``. Queries are
    crawled one at a time: :meth:`start` seeds a single search request and
    every further one is yielded from :meth:`advance_search` after the
    previous search response has been parsed, so only one search request is
    ever outstanding. That keeps the ``/s?`` request rate close to the
    pattern the baseline validated, independently of scheduler behaviour.

    ``asin`` fetches named products directly, with or without any search:

        scrapy crawl amazon_product -a asin="B087WQJQDS; B086BX8M3C"
        scrapy crawl amazon_product -a asin="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B086BX8M3C"

    This exists because **search does not enumerate a shelf**. Measured on the
    tyre mounting paste study: ten queries across four crawls, three of them
    naming the brand outright, never once surfaced `B086BX8M3C` -- not in the
    records and not in the discovery log, which keeps every sighting before
    de-duplication. A reader found it by looking at the manufacturer's own
    catalogue. A keyword crawl measures the queries at least as much as the
    shelf, and without this argument the only way to check one named product
