"""What it costs, and what it costs per unit of content.

Two figures, and the difference between them is the whole of this module.

The **price** is an observation of the offer. Amazon computes it, we read it,
and there is nothing on the page to check it against -- which makes the two
failure modes measured so far both extraction bugs, and worth naming here
because this module cannot catch either one on its own.

The first was an unscoped selector picking a neighbouring product's price out
of a carousel, fixed by reading only from a real price container. The second
survived that fix and was found by a reader who opened the page: a variation
parent with no size chosen renders a *range* in its own, entirely legitimate
price container, and the extractor published the low end of it as the price.
The container was right; what was in it was not a price. Ranges now arrive
here as `price.range` with no `amount`, and this module reports them as
unknown, with the range as the evidence.

The **price per unit of content** is a derivation, and derivations are where
this repository's worst numbers came from. It rests on the pack size, which
is a vendor-filed attribute that is wrong often enough to have driven a whole
milestone. So it is cross-checked against Amazon's own published figure, and
when the two disagree the value says so instead of picking a winner.

The base unit follows the pack, not the category: grams reconcile to a price
per kilogram, millilitres to a price per litre. That generalisation was forced
by the second category rather than designed for it -- dry pasta is sold by
weight and every pack in the validation set reconciled to EUR/kg, while tyre
mounting paste and its neighbours on the same search page are sold in tubs,
tubes, bottles and aerosols, and Amazon prices a third of them per litre.
