"""What survives checking in the review block, and what a sample may not say.

Reviews arrive as two things of very different evidential weight, and the
central job of this module is to stop them being used as though they were the
same.

**The histogram is complete.** Five percentages covering every rating the
listing ever received. Measured across the 38 corpus pages that carry one, it
sums to exactly 100 on every single record and reconstructs Amazon's published
average to within 0.08 stars -- which is what rounding to whole percent
predicts and nothing worse. So it is an *independent* statement of the same
fact the average asserts, from a different structure, and under this layer's
existing rule that is what promotes a value from unverified to trusted.

**The sample is a sample, and a biased one.** Amazon renders eight to thirteen
review cards into a PDP out of a total that is often in the thousands, chosen
by its own relevance logic. Three consequences this module enforces rather
than documents:

1. *No rate may be computed from it.* "Three of nine reviews mention broken
   grain" is not 33% of anything. A complaint found in the sample establishes
   **presence**, never frequency, and the Value that carries it says so.
2. *Absence proves nothing at all.* Nine cards not mentioning a problem is
   consistent with a hundred reviews that do. The correct status for "not
   found in the sample" is ``unknown``, not ``not_claimed`` -- which is the
   opposite of how the same question is answered for a *vendor* claim, where
   the vendor controls the whole page and silence is informative.
3. *The negative share comes from the histogram, never from the sample.* The
   one-and-two-star percentage is a complete statistic and is the honest way
   to ask "how often does this go wrong".

Two pooling problems the page hides and this module surfaces:

``pooled across variants``
    Amazon shows every review of a parent ASIN's whole family. A five-kilogram
    bag and a one-kilogram bag of different rice share a review set. The
    format strip names the variant per card, so the pooling is *measurable*
    rather than merely suspected.

``pooled across marketplaces``
    A dateline reading "Bewertet in Italien" is a review of a different
    marketplace's listing, machine-translated onto this page. Across the
    corpus, **82 of 277 cards (30%)** are foreign. They are kept -- a
    complaint about a smell is a complaint about a smell -- but they are
    counted apart, because the batch, the importer and sometimes the product
    differ.

Nothing here knows what the product is. Which *words* are worth hunting for in
review prose is category knowledge, and lives in a category module; this layer
supplies :func:`search` so it can be done against the right text with the
right provenance attached.
