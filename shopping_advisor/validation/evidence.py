"""Values that carry their own provenance, and the search over a record.

The extraction layer answers "what does the page say". This module is the
vocabulary for the layer above it, which answers a harder question: "how much
of that should we believe". Every number and every claim the platform surfaces
is a :class:`Value`, which names two independent things:

``source``
    *How the value was obtained* -- a structure Amazon renders as data, a
    key/value attribute row, prose written by the vendor, a figure Amazon
    itself computed, or something this layer derived.

``status``
    *Whether it survived validation* -- trusted, disputed, unverified or
    unknown.

Keeping them apart is the whole point, and it is a correction rather than a
refinement. The extractor used to publish a single ``confidence`` that mixed
them, ranking Amazon's structured nutrition card above prose; measured over
the 195-record validation set, ``high``-confidence records failed plausibility
*more* often than ``medium`` ones (5/45 versus 2/40). A well-rendered table is
evidence about the vendor's care in filling a form, not about the number.

A populated field is not a fact. The same validation set contains a structured
nutrition card stating 87.7 kcal/100 g for dry pasta, and a prose match that
turned the phrase "Ballaststoffe pro 100g" into "100 g of fibre". Neither is
an extraction bug. Both are why status, source and evidence travel with the
value rather than being reconstructed later.

# A note on ``derived``, because it is the one source whose bearing on status
# is not uniform. A derived value is exactly as good as its inputs, so whether
# it can be trusted depends on whether *they* were validated:
#
# * ``price_per_base`` is derived from price and pack size. When the pack size
#   was confirmed by an independent statement on the page, the quotient is as
#   solid as its inputs and is trusted.
# * a derived *nutrient* -- kcal computed from kJ -- is a unit conversion of a
#   single unchecked number. It adds no evidence about that number, so it can
#   never be more believable than the row it came from, and the nutrition
#   rules refuse to promote it.
#
# Which is why this is a comment and not a constant: a blanket rule here would
# be wrong in one of the two directions, and it was, in the first draft.
