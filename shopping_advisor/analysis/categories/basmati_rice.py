"""Basmati rice: the third category, and the first with a buyer's side.

The question is "which basmati should I eat every week", and it is a harder
shape than either category before it. Dry pasta is decided by a number on the
page (price per kilogram, once the pack size is believed). Tyre mounting paste
is decided by a property Amazon almost never states. Basmati is decided by
**three things at once** -- is it really basmati, does it taste like basmati,
and is it clean -- which are answered by three *different* kinds of evidence,
only one of which the vendor controls.

What this module knows that the layers beneath it cannot:

**Authenticity has an external standard, and it is checkable.** Basmati is not
a marketing adjective in the EU. Duty-free import is restricted to a named
list of varieties, authenticity certificates are issued against it, and
imports are DNA-tested for variety. The trade's Code of Practice tolerates at
most 7% non-basmati grain in something sold as basmati. So a listing that
names its cultivar is making a claim that *could* be checked against a real
register, and one that does not is asking to be taken on trust. That is a
genuine quality signal and it is rare: see ``CULTIVARS`` below.

**"Named cultivar" is an authenticity signal and not an aroma signal.** These
were conflated in the brief this category was built for. In January 2023 six
varieties were struck off the permitted list precisely because DNA testing
showed they had never been bred for fragrance -- some lack the *BADH2* gene
that produces 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, the compound basmati smells of. A cultivar
name therefore establishes *what it is*, and says much less than expected
about *what it tastes like*. Both are tracked, separately.

**Processing type is a health axis here, not only a taste one.** The brief
excluded parboiled/Sella and brown rice on grounds of taste and tradition.
Independent German laboratory testing puts the same exclusion on a firmer
footing: arsenic concentrates in the bran, so brown rice carries more of it
than white from the same paddy, and Öko-Test measured its highest arsenic
values in brown and parboiled rice while finding only traces in basmati. The
brief's instinct was right; the reason it gave was not the strongest one
available. Both processing type and its arsenic consequence are surfaced.

**Bio is not a health claim, and this module refuses to treat it as one.**
Inorganic arsenic is geogenic -- it comes out of the soil and the irrigation
water, not out of a spray can -- so organic certification does not predict it.
The measured case is unambiguous and it is in ``tests.py``'s fixtures: a
fair-trade organic basmati failed Öko-Test outright on mineral oil and MOAH,
and DNA analysis put 20% foreign varieties in the bag. Bio and Fairtrade are
recorded as what they are -- statements about farming method and trade terms --
and are never allowed to stand in for a contaminant measurement.

Scoring is the one place this module departs from the platform's usual rule,
and it does so deliberately and visibly. See :func:`score`.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Scoring
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: The seven components, their weights, and why each weight is what it is.
#:
#: This module scores, and the rest of the platform deliberately does not:
#: ``analysis/report.py`` ranks on one axis at a time and says in as many
#: words that a composite "could not answer why A is better than B". That
#: objection is correct and it is the reason for the shape below rather than
#: an argument against having one. Three rules keep it answerable:
#:
#: 1. **Every component is reported, never just the total.** A score of 62 is
#:    published as its seven parts, each with the evidence under it.
#: 2. **No component may be filled in by assumption.** A missing input scores
#:    the *neutral* value for that component, not zero and not full marks, and
#:    the card says how many components were unknown. A product cannot win by
#:    being silent, and it cannot lose for being silent either.
#: 3. **Nothing unverified scores as if it were verified.** A claim that the
#:    vendor makes and nobody checked is worth a fraction of the same claim
#:    with an independent measurement behind it, and the fraction is explicit
#:    in the code below.
#:
#: The weights answer the brief's three questions -- tasty, genuine, sensible
#: to eat often -- with authenticity weighted highest because it is the one
#: that decides whether the other two are even about basmati.
WEIGHTS = {
    'authenticity': 22,   # is it really basmati, and can that be checked
    'taste': 20,          # aroma and texture, mostly from buyers
    'grain': 12,          # milling, breakage, processing type
    'transparency': 14,   # what the seller is willing to state
    'health': 18,         # contaminant evidence, processing, additives
    'consistency': 8,     # does it arrive the same way twice
    'value': 6,           # price per kilogram
}

#: What a score of "we know nothing about this" should be. Not zero: a
#: product nobody has measured is not a bad product.
NEUTRAL_SCORE = 50.0

#: How far an entirely unevidenced score is pulled back toward neutral. At
#: 0.6, a listing with none of the six evidence checks satisfied keeps 40% of
#: its distance from 50, so claims still count for something and cannot carry
#: a product on their own.
SHRINK = 0.6

#: Number of checks :func:`_unknown_components` can report as missing.
EVIDENCE_CHECKS = 7

#: The most an authenticity score built purely from the seller's own text may
#: reach. Vendor claims are `unverified` by the contract's own vocabulary, and
#: this is that word expressed as a number.
