"""Rich, marketplace-aware extraction of Amazon product detail pages.

Layering::

    text.py          locale-agnostic text and number primitives
    marketplaces.py  per-location labels, currency and number format
    blocks.py        generic harvesters for Amazon's page structures
    reviews.py       the ratings histogram and the rendered review sample
    pdp.py           composes one product record and records provenance

Typical use from a spider::

    from shopping_advisor.extraction import PdpExtractor, for_domain

    extractor = PdpExtractor(for_domain('www.amazon.de'))
    record = extractor.extract(response.selector, response.text, lineage)
