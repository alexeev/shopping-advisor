"""The review block: the sample Amazon renders, and the distribution behind it.

Two structures, and the difference between them is the whole point.

The **histogram** is a statement about *every* rating the listing has ever
received: five percentages, one per star. It is cheap, it is complete, and it
is the only review evidence on the page that is not a sample of anything.

The **sample** is the handful of reviews Amazon chose to render into the PDP --
eight to thirteen of them, selected by Amazon's own "most helpful" and
"most recent" logic, out of a total that is frequently in the thousands. It is
where the words are, and the words are the only place a reader learns that the
grains arrive broken or the bag smelled of nothing.

The sample is not a random draw and this module does not pretend otherwise; it
records how many were rendered against how many exist, and the layer above
refuses to compute a rate from it. What the sample *can* carry is the presence
of a complaint, which is a different and weaker claim than its frequency.

Three things the widget states that a naive read merges and should not:

``variant``
    "Größe: 5 kg (1er Pack)". Amazon pools reviews across every pack size and
    sometimes across unrelated flavours of one parent ASIN, so a review on the
    page may be about a product the reader is not looking at. The format strip
    says which, when it is present.

``home``
    A dateline reading "Bewertet in Italien" came from the *other countries*
    section: a different marketplace's listing, machine-translated. Real
    evidence, different product-market, flagged rather than dropped.

``verified``
    Whether Amazon could tie the review to a purchase it processed.

Nothing here knows what the product is, and nothing here decides whether a
review should be believed. Extraction stays faithful to the page; see
:mod:`shopping_advisor.validation.reviews` for what survives checking.
