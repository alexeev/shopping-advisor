# The extraction and validation contract

What downstream code may rely on, what it may not, and what has to change
before either of those changes. Two artefacts are published here:

| Artefact | Version | Produced by | Answers |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Product record** | `SCHEMA_VERSION = 6` | `shopping_advisor.extraction` | what the page says |
| **Validated record** | `CONTRACT_VERSION = 2` | `shopping_advisor.validation` | how much of that holds up |

They are versioned separately because they change for different reasons and
have different consumers. An extractor learning to read a new Amazon
structure moves the first; a rule learning that a value cannot be confirmed
moves the second.

```text

```

## 1. Why there are two layers and not one

A populated field is not a fact. Amazon's *structured* nutrition card states
87.7 kcal per 100 g for dry pasta on one record and 7 g of carbohydrate on
another; a sixteen-pack of Garofalo reports €62.56/kg because the vendor filed
`Anzahl der Einheiten: 500 gramm`, and Amazon's own price per kilogram agrees
with it because it is computed from the same wrong row.

The extractor's job is to be faithful to the page, including when the page is
wrong. Deciding what to believe is a separate job, with separate evidence, and
it is done once — not per category.

### The mistake this replaces

Schema v3 published `food.nutrition.confidence` (`high` / `medium` / `low`),
set from *which structure* the numbers came from. Measured over the
195-record Amazon.de validation set, `high`-confidence records failed
plausibility checks **more** often than `medium` ones — 5 of 45 against 2 of
40. A well-rendered table is evidence about the care a vendor took filling in
a form. It is not evidence about the number.

So v4 removes `confidence` and the contract splits it in two:

- **`source`** — how the value was obtained. Extraction may state this,
  because it knows it and it is a fact about the page.
- **`status`** — whether the value survived checking. Only the validation
  layer may state this, and never from the source alone.

## 2. The product record (schema v6)

One JSON object per line. Every group degrades to `{}` / `[]` rather than
disappearing, so consumers can index without guards.

| Group | Keys |
|---|---|
| envelope | `schema_version`, `fetched_at` |
| lineage | `marketplace`, `asin`, `product_url`, `canonical_url`, `search_query`, `search_page`, `search_position`, `run_id`, `locale`, `accept_language` |
| core | `title`, `brand`, `byline_text`, `brand_url`, `price{amount,currency,text,range?}`, `unit_price{amount,unit,text}`, `rating{value,count,text,count_text}`, `availability`, `seller`, `breadcrumbs[]` |
| package | `item_weight_*`, `package_weight_*`, `unit_count_*`, `volume_*`, `item_count`, `size_name`, `dimensions`, `total_quantity_base`, `total_quantity_unit`, `total_quantity_source` |
| content | `feature_bullets[]`, `description`, `important_information[{heading,text}]`, `aplus{module_types,headings,text,text_length,images,tables}` |
| food | `ingredients{text,source}`, `allergens[]`, `nutrition{source,basis_text,per_100g,rows,derived}` |
| attributes | `attributes{}` (canonical), `raw_tables{}` (verbatim), `attribute_sources{}` |
| media | `images[{url,variant,alt,thumb}]`, `primary_image`, `image_count`, `image_source` |
| variation | `dimensions[]`, `display_labels{}`, `variation_values{}`, `values_by_asin{asin:[…]}`, `current_asin`, `parent_asin`, `total_variations` — decoded verbatim, never interpreted |
| reviews | `histogram_percent{five_star…one_star}`, `sample[]`, `sample_size`, `sample_home`, `rating_count`, `sample_source` |
| diagnostics | `extraction{blocks_present[],blocks_absent[],errors[]}` |

`nutrition.per_100g` uses canonical keys: `energy_kj`, `energy_kcal`,
`protein_g`, `fat_g`, `saturated_fat_g`, `carbohydrates_g`, `sugars_g`,
`fiber_g`, `salt_g`, `sodium_mg`.

`nutrition.source` is one of `nutrition_card`, `attributes`, or `text:<field>`
— **which structure the numbers came from, and nothing more**.

In schema v6, `price.range` retains the bounds when the page presents a price
range. `price.amount` is then absent: one end of a range is not the price of a
selected offer. See §7 for the migration history.

### `reviews` — one complete structure and one sample, never confused

Added in v5. The two halves of this block have very different evidential
weight and the names say so.

`histogram_percent` is **complete**: five whole-percent shares covering every
rating the listing ever received. Measured over the 38 corpus pages that carry
one, it sums to exactly 100 on **every** record and reconstructs Amazon's
published average to within **0.08 stars**. It is therefore an independent
statement of the same fact the average asserts, and the validation layer uses
it to promote the average under the ordinary corroboration rule.

`sample` is **8–13 review cards Amazon chose**, out of a `rating_count` often
in the thousands. Each card carries `rating`, `title`, `text`, `date`,
`country`, `home_marketplace`, `variant`, `verified` and `helpful_votes`. Three
of those exist because the page merges things a reader should not:

* `home_marketplace: false` marks the "reviews from other countries" section —
  a different marketplace's listing, machine-translated. **82 of 277 corpus
  cards (30%)** are foreign.
* `variant` is Amazon's format strip ("Größe: 5 kg (1er Pack)"). Reviews are
  pooled across every pack size of a parent ASIN, and sometimes across
  different products.
* `verified` is Amazon's purchase badge. 271 of 277 corpus cards carry it, so
  a listing where most do not is an outlier worth noticing.

`sample_source` is `'pdp_widget'` and is named rather than implied: this is the
only review data reachable without an account, because `/product-reviews/<ASIN>`
redirects to sign-in. **No rate may be computed from `sample`.**

`package.total_quantity_base` is grams or millilitres, and
`total_quantity_unit` says which. The unit follows the attribute row the total
was read from — not a volume mentioned elsewhere on the page. Before v4 it was
inferred from any volume field present, which reported a 50 ml sponge tin as
50 g and then priced it per kilogram.

## 3. The validated record (contract v2)

`shopping_advisor.validation.validate(record, profile) -> Validated`

The Python API defaults to a neutral profile when called as `validate(record)`;
the saved-page corpus pins this neutral output. The `analysis validated` CLI
instead supplies the selected category's profile (default `dry_pasta`), applying
its plausibility bands without running its classifier or claim evaluator. It
has no neutral-profile switch. See [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md#offline-walkthrough)
for an executable example.

```python
from shopping_advisor.validation import validate, CategoryProfile

validated = validate(record, CategoryProfile(key='paint', label='wall paint'))
validated.quantity.status        # 'trusted'
validated.quantity.source        # 'attributes'
validated.price_per_base.unit    # 'EUR/l'
validated.as_dict()              # JSON-serialisable, snapshot-tested
```

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `contract_version`, `schema_version` | int | this shape, and the record's |
| `category_profile` | str | the profile's `key`, or `'product'` for none |
| `asin`, `title`, `brand`, `url`, `marketplace`, `query`, `run_id`, `locale` | str | lineage, copied |
| `offer` | `(family, signature)` or `None` | identity of "this product, in whatever pack size", **scoped by marketplace** since v2 |
| `size_label`, `siblings`, `variation` | str / list / dict | Amazon's own pack label and family |
| `quantity` | `Value` | total pack content, in `g` or `ml` |
| `price` | `Value` | what the listing costs |
| `price_per_base` | `Value` | price per kilogram or per litre, following the pack's unit |
| `nutrition` | `{key: Value}` | per 100 g; `{}` for anything that is not food |
| `review_rating` | `Value` | average stars; `trusted` only when the histogram corroborates it and the rating count is not trivially small |
| `review_negative_share` | `Value` | share of all ratings at 1–2★, from the complete histogram — the only review figure entitled to be read as a rate |
| `review_sample` | `Value` | the rendered cards; **never better than `unverified`**, carrying every caveat that limits reading them |
| `record` | dict | the raw record used for category text search; not included by `as_dict()` |

`as_dict()` also omits the raw `variation` matrix and serializes `review_sample`
as its count plus status/evidence, rather than duplicating all review text.

### Listing identity is a marketplace and an ASIN

An ASIN is minted per Amazon site. The same ten characters name different
products on different marketplaces, and where they name the same product it is
a different offer, in another currency, with another delivery region. So the
identity of a listing is the **normalised host plus the ASIN** — `www.` is
stripped, case is folded — and `offer[0]` carries that host: `'amazon.de:B0PARENT01'`.

An empty prefix (`':B0PARENT01'`) means the record did not record a
marketplace. That is its own scope, not membership of any other: the saved-page
corpus extracts with no marketplace in its lineage, so its snapshot shows the
empty form. A record written by the spider always names one.

Two consumers depend on this and both were wrong before v2: feed merging keyed
by ASIN alone discarded a `.de` observation in favour of a `.com` one, and
variation grouping pooled a family across marketplaces. Comparison across
marketplaces remains unsupported regardless — the analysis CLI stops rather
than ranking two currencies together.

`Validated` also exposes `search_reviews(pattern, …)` and
`review_signal(pattern, label, …)`, kept deliberately separate from `search()`,
which walks the *vendor's* words. A producer's claim and a reader's experience
of it are different kinds of evidence, and a hunter that merged them would let
marketing copy corroborate itself.

For vendor claims, `not_claimed` means no accepted match in the selected search
scope, not that the property is false or that every possible source was checked.
Amazon selects which buyer cards to render, so a complaint absent from that
sample is `unknown`.

### `Value`

```python
Value(value, status, unit, evidence=[Evidence(field, quote)], notes=[], source='')
```

`.usable` is true only for `trusted` values with a value. Nothing else may be
ranked on or asserted from.

The status applies to the proposition being checked. A category can mark a
vendor declaration `trusted` because it found attributable text; this does not
independently verify the claimed performance. Likewise, histogram agreement
checks rating consistency, not review authenticity or product quality. Reports
must preserve this distinction and the source attribution. Basmati's optional
composite is a separate category method, not a generic trusted numeric axis;
its ingredients and unknowns must remain visible, and the CLI `rank` does not
sort by that score.

### Attributed text search

Both `search(record, pattern, limit=3, fields=None, *, scope='page',
affirmative=False, exclude=None)` and `Validated.search(pattern, …)` return
`Evidence` quotes in source order, with at most one accepted match per field.
String patterns are case-insensitive; compiled regexes retain their flags.

- `scope='page'` preserves the original discovery search: ingredients, title,
  feature bullets, description, raw attribute rows, important information and
  A+ text. Reviews have their own API. This is the extracted vendor text, not
  every string in the JSON record or original HTML.
- `scope='self'` restricts to `food.ingredients`, `title`, and `raw_tables`.
  These are the conservative sources for what a listing contains. This field
  policy does **not** guarantee that a title or attribute row is accurate or
  mentions only the product being sold.
- `fields` intersects the selected scope. Paths select themselves and their
  descendants (`content.feature_bullets` includes indexed bullets); an empty
  collection selects nothing. An unknown scope raises `ValueError`; a
  nonpositive limit returns no hits.
- `affirmative=True` filters adjacent German/English negating prefixes
  (`nicht`, `non-`, `ohne`, `without`, `free of`, etc.) and `frei`/`free`
  suffixes. It checks the context **outside the matched phrase**, so matching
  `mineralöl` in `mineralölfrei` is rejected, while matching `mineralölfrei`
  or `ohne Mineralöl` affirms the absence claim. Internal negation belongs to
  the meaning of the caller's pattern; arbitrary grammar, double negations,
  comparisons and cross-sell attribution are not resolved.
- `exclude` supplies an optional category-specific regex, such as a drying
  denial containing `trocknet nicht ein`. A candidate is rejected only when
  its span overlaps an exclusion match, not because an unrelated negation
  occurs elsewhere in the quote. Filtering runs against the full source text
  before quote cropping or result limits, and continues to later matches in
  the same field. Rejected matches remain discoverable with default search.

Search returns evidence, never a trust status. Basmati uses `self` and
affirmative matching for milling; mounting paste retains `page` search for
claims in prose, with category exclusions and kit caveats. A page match alone
does not resolve which product a claim concerns.

External laboratory attribution stays in the basmati category. The known
product-line match must also have a literal whole-brand match in the brand
or manufacturer field to receive its existing `trusted` status. Those fields
are included as evidence. A title-only match stays `unverified`; even matching
metadata does not prove that the listing's batch or pack was the tested one.

R7 adds these opt-in search controls within contract v1; the serialized
validated record and extraction schema are unchanged.

### Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `trusted` | survived every check that applies to it |
| `disputed` | sources on the page contradict each other, or a check failed — shown with the contradiction, never ranked |
| `unverified` | nothing contradicts it, nothing independent confirms it |
| `unknown` | we do not know; distinct from "the page does not say" |
| `not_claimed` | no accepted claim in the caller's search scope — which is not the same as it being untrue |

### Source vocabulary

| Source | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `structured` | a structure Amazon renders as data: the nutrition card, the twister matrix |
| `attributes` | a row of a product-detail key/value table, filed by the vendor |
| `text` | prose: the title, a bullet, the description, A+ copy |
| `published` | a figure Amazon computed and published, e.g. its own price per unit |
| `derived` | computed here, from other values on the same record |

**A source never implies a status.** The nearest thing to an exception is
`derived`, and it is not one: a derived value is exactly as good as its
inputs, so whether it can be trusted depends on whether *they* were
validated. `price_per_base` is derived from price and pack size, and is
trusted when the pack size was confirmed by an independent statement on the
page. A derived *nutrient* — kcal computed from kJ — is a unit conversion of a
single unchecked number, adds no evidence about it, and is never promoted.

`Evidence.field` carries the precise origin; `source` is the coarse kind.

---

## 4. What the generic rules check

Each fires only where its evidence exists. A record with no food block pays
nothing for the nutrition rules.

**Pack quantity** — the attribute total against every *independent* statement
of it on the page: the variation matrix's size dimension, the title, the
pack-size name. A count is only ever combined with a weight stated in the
same string; multiplying a title's pack count by the attribute table's item
weight is circular, because whether that weight is per item or per pack is the
question under dispute. A bare, uncounted weight in the listing's own text may
**confirm** a total and may never contradict one.

**Price per base unit** — derived from price and pack size, cross-checked
against Amazon's own published per-unit figure. The published figure is
converted onto the pack's own dimension (`kg`, `100 g`, `l`, `ml`, `100 ml`)
and **refused** when it counts pieces rather than content, or when converting
it would need a density nobody published.

**Nutrition** — a unit that cannot measure the field it populated; a number
lifted out of the "per 100 g" phrase that describes the basis; macronutrients
summing to more than the food they sit in; energy disagreeing with the
macronutrients it is computed from (Atwater, 35% tolerance); and a declaration
carrying a single nutrient, which has nothing on the page to confirm it.

**Variation** — family identity and the pack-size dimension, looked up by
Amazon's own dimension names, never inferred.

---

## 5. What a category supplies, and what it may not

A category hands the generic layer a `CategoryProfile`, which is **data only**:

```python
CategoryProfile(
    key='dry_pasta',
    label='dry pasta',
    nutrition_bands={'protein_g': (4.0, 30.0), ...},   # per 100 g
    price_band=(0.80, 40.00),                          # per kg or per litre
)
```

A profile cannot add a rule, reorder the pipeline, or set a status. That is
deliberate, and it is the part of R2 that took the longest to get right,
because the ordering is not obvious:

```text
detect  →  category bands  →  resolve contradictions  →  promote
```

A generic check can prove that an energy figure and its own macronutrients
contradict each other, but not which side is wrong; a plausibility band can
say which value is impossible, but only for a named category. So the bands run
in the middle, and **nothing is promoted to `trusted` until both have
spoken**. While this sequence lived inside the pasta module, the pasta module
*was* the specification, and a second category would have had to copy four
lines of ordering it had no way to know were load-bearing.

`price_band=None` is a legitimate answer, not a gap. Tyre mounting paste
spans 50 ml tubes and 5 kg workshop tubs priced two orders of magnitude apart
per kilogram; inventing a band to have one would reject real listings.

A category analyzer then adds what only it can know — what the product *is*,
which of the vendor's statements matter, and which direction is better — and
returns a card. `tests/test_mounting_paste.py` asserts mechanically that it
imports no rule and settles no numeric value of its own.

A card key a category adds beyond the common shape — basmati's cultivar,
grain type, external test, review signals and score — is **declared** in
`Category.extras`, and that declaration is what publishes it in
`card --json`. It is a rendering statement rather than a contract change: the
values themselves are `Value`s that serialise as they always did, and until
T2 the JSON view named two such keys by hand and silently dropped basmati's
six. A key a category adds and does not declare is not published.

---

## 6. Compatibility policy

### Within a version

May change without a bump, because no correct consumer can depend on it:

- adding a key to the record or to `Validated`;
- adding a `status`- or `source`-bearing value to a group that already exists;
- the **wording** of a `note`, and the span of an evidence `quote`;
- which `Evidence` entries accompany a value, and their order;
- a value moving to a *more* conservative status (`trusted` → `unverified` →
  `disputed`/`unknown`) because a new rule found something.

### Requires a version bump

- removing or renaming a key, a `status` value or a `source` value;
- changing the unit or scale of a published number;
- changing what a `status` *means*;
- a value moving to a *less* conservative status by default — that is a claim
  about trustworthiness, and it has to be argued for and measured.

### How a bump is done

1. Change the code and bump `SCHEMA_VERSION` (`extraction/pdp.py`) or
   `CONTRACT_VERSION` (`validation/contract.py`).
2. Add a line to §7 saying what moved and why.
3. Regenerate the corpus snapshots and **read the diff**:
   ```bash
   uv run python tests/test_corpus.py --update
   ```
   `tests/corpus/` pins both artefacts over 39 saved real pages —
   `expected.jsonl.gz` for extraction and `validated.jsonl.gz` for the
   contract, the latter deliberately produced with *no* category profile, so
   what is pinned is the layer that belongs to nobody.
4. Records already on disk keep their own `schema_version`. The validation
   layer reads v2 and v3 records unchanged; older records simply carry fields
   it ignores.
5. Re-record the [maintenance gate](AGENTS.md#environment-and-checks) baseline
   in the same change: it pins every published version listed in §7 and the
   T3 audit contracts below, and it fails on a number that moved without this
   procedure. That is the point of it — a bump is a statement about meaning,
   and an unremarked one is the failure this section exists to prevent.

---

## 7. Version history

| Version | Change |
|---|---|
| schema v1 | the original rich PDP record |
| schema v2 | crawl provenance: `run_id`, `locale`, `accept_language` (R1) |
| schema v3 | `variation`: the twister matrix, decoded verbatim (R1) |
| **schema v4** | removed `food.nutrition.confidence`; `package.total_quantity_unit` now follows the row the total came from (R2) |
| **schema v5** | added `reviews`: the complete ratings histogram and the sample of cards the PDP renders (R5). **Purely additive** — every schema-4 field keeps its name and meaning, and the corpus regression diff touched only `reviews.*` and `extraction.blocks_present` |
| **schema v6** | `price.range`, and `price.amount` is no longer filled from one end of a price range. A variation parent with no size selected renders "5,63€ - 26,15€" in its own price container; the extractor published 5,63 EUR as the price of a listing that cost 9,98. Additive for every record that has a price; the 7 records in the mounting-paste sets that had a *fabricated* one now correctly have none |
| **contract v1** | first published validated record (R2); extended in R5 with `review_rating`, `review_negative_share` and `review_sample`, which add fields without changing any existing one. A `price.range` reads as `unknown` with the range as its evidence — it adds no field to the validated record, because "we do not know" was already expressible |
| **contract v2** | `offer` is scoped by marketplace (T1). The field keeps its shape — a family identity and a variant signature — but the identity is no longer a bare parent ASIN, which is only unique within one Amazon site. That is a change in what a published value *means*, so it is a bump rather than an addition. The corpus regression diff touched exactly two fields on the 39 saved pages: `contract_version` on all of them, and `offer[0]` on the 27 that carry a family, which gain the (empty, because the corpus records no marketplace) host prefix. No status, value, source or note moved |

---

## 8. What the second category changed

R2's premise was that a rule earns promotion once a *second* consumer has
exercised it. The second consumer is tyre mounting paste: a non-food, with no
nutrition, sold in tubs, tubes, bottles and aerosols, classified from its
title because Amazon files it under four unrelated departments, and ranked on
*smallest pack first* — the opposite of what dry pasta wants. 90 records,
three Amazon.de queries, 93 requests, 93 × HTTP 200, 0 retries, 0 challenges.

**Every trust rule transferred unchanged.** Nothing in the quantity, price or
variation logic needed to know what the product was. What did change:

1. **Price per unit was hard-wired to kilograms.** Every pack in the dry-pasta
   set is a mass, so nothing had ever asked. A third of the paste listings are
   priced per litre by Amazon, and the layer ignored those figures entirely
   rather than converting them. Now the base unit follows the pack, Amazon's
   published unit price is converted onto it, and a per-*piece* figure is
   refused rather than misread — which is the error that once showed a Barilla
   listing at €38.56/kg.

2. **An extraction bug surfaced.** `total_quantity_unit` was inferred from any
   volume field on the page rather than from the row the total came from, so a
   50 ml tin filed as `Anzahl der Einheiten: 50.0 milliliter` was reported as
   50 g. 16 of 90 paste records are affected; 1 of 39 corpus pages changed,
   and that one — a 5 L olive-oil canister filed as 5 kg — loses a per-litre
   figure that had been `trusted` on the strength of the old guess. It is now
   an unverified price per kilogram with a note saying the two cannot be
   reconciled without a density. That is the honest reading.

3. **A confidently wrong nutrition value was one step away.** German *Fett*
   means grease as well as fat, so four listings here state a pack size beside
   the word and the food parser reads a nutrition declaration: `Fett wird in
   einer 100 g Tube geliefert` → 100 g of fat per 100 g. Two of the four state
   "100 g" close enough to satisfy the per-100 g basis test, so nothing in the
   generic layer stopped them — dry pasta was protected only by having a
   plausibility band. The rule that was missing is category-neutral: **a
   declaration carrying one nutrient has nothing on the page to confirm it, so
   it can be shown but never trusted.** Thirteen lone-nutrient blocks exist
   across the two validation sets and all thirteen are artefacts of matching a
   word — nine in dry pasta, six of those reporting 100 g of protein per 100 g
   and one reporting 534.

4. **Pack quantity could barely be confirmed at all.** The hint parser only
   understood multipack phrasing — "6 × 500 g", "500 g (5er Pack)" — which
   this category does not use. It writes "Reifenmontagepaste 5 kg" and means
   it. 2 of 43 pastes had a confirmable pack size. The rule added is narrow
   and asymmetric: when nothing anywhere on the page claims more than one
   unit, a bare weight in the listing's own text is an independent statement
   of the same quantity and may **confirm** the attribute total — never
   contradict it, because the weight may still be per unit or a kit's shipping
   weight. On dry pasta it moves 23 records from `unverified` to `trusted` and
   leaves every `disputed` and every `unknown` exactly as it was.

### Measured, both categories, after R2

| | dry pasta (195 records) | tyre mounting paste (90 records) |
|---|---|---|
| Classified | 165 / 30 other / 0 unclassified | 43 / 47 other / 0 unclassified |
| Pack quantity | 131 trusted · 13 disputed · 14 unverified · 7 unknown | 25 trusted · 1 disputed · 6 unverified · 11 unknown |
| Price per base unit | 100 trusted · 9 disputed · 2 unverified · 54 unknown | 13 trusted · 1 disputed · 1 unverified · 28 unknown |
| At least one trusted axis | 117 of 165 | 32 of 43 |

Effect of R2 on dry pasta, same records, same code path:

| | before | after |
|---|---:|---:|
| Pack quantity trusted | 108 | **131** |
| Pack quantity unverified | 37 | **14** |
| Pack quantity disputed / unknown | 13 / 7 | 13 / 7 *(identical)* |
| Price per base unit | 100 trusted | 100 trusted *(identical)* |
| Protein trusted | 61 | 60 |

The one lost protein figure is `B0D4R3N142`, a lupin-flour pasta whose only
nutrition value is `"Protein und 9g"` scraped out of marketing copy — a
figure that is implausibly *low* for the product it describes.

## 8. Study audit contracts (T3)

R13 stage 3 separates the three version constants in `study/audit.py`:
`LEDGER_VERSION` governs `ledger_version`, `AUDIT_VERSION` governs
`audit_version` in the claim index and validation result, and `REVIEW_VERSION`
governs `review_version`. All remain **1**. The maintenance gate tracks them
independently as `evidence_ledger`, `study_audit` and `semantic_review`.
This separation changes no artifact bytes, study identity or review binding.

Study manifests now write **v2**, adding `ledger.json`, `claim-index.json`,
`validation.json`, and `semantic-review.json`. V1 bundles remain historical
artifacts; this build refuses to validate them as v2. Re-run their original
brief and pinned feeds into a new directory. Brief v1, extraction schema v6
and generic validation contract v2 are unchanged.

The external ledger is **v1**. Its executable schema is
`shopping_advisor/study/audit.py:check_ledger`; a complete JSON example is
`tests/studies/t3/evidence.json`. Each observation has a unique ID, source ID,
class, publisher, title, URL, publication/retrieval dates, locator, claim,
excerpt, original units, quotation/interpretation distinction, verification,
product identity, matching status, applicability limits, conflicts and
supersession links. Unknown legacy dates/identity/URLs remain empty, not inferred.
Verified sources require ISO dates and a URL/locator. A snapshot either embeds
permitted UTF-8 text and its SHA-256 or declares unavailability and a reason.
The digest covers the retained text, not an unavailable original document.

Indexed external claims reference an observation and declare their scope:
`historical`, `current_batch`, `vendor_declaration`, `review_sample`, or
`access_limit`. Their statement must equal the recorded source claim (or access
limit). A listing reference is `marketplace:ASIN`; identity matches use JSON
Pointers into the selected feed record. Brand, model, variant and geography
must match exactly and be known; current-batch claims additionally require the
batch, a reference date at or after publication, independent evidence, and no
conflicts or supersession. This conservative matching may refuse usable evidence
that requires interpretation; a semantic reviewer cannot override a failed
check by approving prose. Record uncertainty or historical scope instead.

Source verification is an operator assertion, distinct from generic `trusted`.
Digest and matching checks cannot prove semantic truth. Vendor text supports
an attributed declaration; buyer samples support sampled experiences, never
population rates. Secondary reports cannot be promoted to primary tests.
Unverified or unavailable sources support access-limit claims only. Historical
findings without listing claims need no guessed listing match.

The claim index records the adopted single-axis method, decision/card references,
computation names and pinned feed references. Full replay checks ranking,
eligibility, grouping, numeric claims, every serialized card/score and exact
report rendering. No arbitrary hand-written additions are validated. Freshness
violations or unknown age explicitly label the report historical/incomplete.
Basmati's score is published for inspection; **it does not order the shortlist**,
and external claims do not silently change the adopted price ranking.

The semantic review is **v1** and separately binds the report and evidence/decision
artifact digests. Ledger content also participates in the study ID. It records reviewer, citation support, variant applicability,
user priorities, coverage/limits, findings for each check and unresolved limits.
`pending` is not approval. `validate-report --require-review` requires a complete
passing review; plain `verify` checks replay without claiming semantic approval.

**Basmati method v2:** three former executable test constants move to
`shopping_advisor/evidence/basmati-legacy.json` as `legacy_unverified`, with
explicit missing citations/snapshot and unresolved applicability. `external:`
evidence fields resolve to these ledger observation IDs. None earns laboratory
score credit. The health component starts neutral (0.5), without unsupported
milling/origin/vendor-safety bonuses; existing adverse review adjustments remain
category heuristics. Missing verified external evidence remains a reported score
gap. This is a conservative trust correction and versioned category method,
not a change to generic status meanings. See the measured T3 result in ROADMAP.
