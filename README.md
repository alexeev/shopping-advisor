# Amazon product research with Scrapy

Collect Amazon product pages, preserve their evidence, validate extracted
values, and compare products using category-specific rules. The active spider
is **`amazon_product`**; it handles search, pagination, and direct ASIN fetches.

## Start here

| Need | Read |
|---|---|
| Operate or maintain the repository as an agent | [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) — canonical instructions for either provider stack |
| Research a product or try the offline example | [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md) — current runbook and commands |
| Understand fields and trust semantics | [CONTRACT.md](CONTRACT.md) — extraction schema **6**, validation contract **2** |
| Understand priorities and previous decisions | [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) |
| Understand the agent transition | [AGENT_TRANSITION_PLAN.md](AGENT_TRANSITION_PLAN.md) — T0 and T1 delivered; T2–T5 planned |

`CLAUDE.md` is a thin entry point to the same instructions. If an agent does
not automatically discover repository instructions, tell it to read
`AGENTS.md` and `RESEARCH.md` before starting. There is no provider SDK or API
credential required for crawling, analysis, or tests.

## Supported scope

- **Amazon.de** is the validated research marketplace, with an explicit German
  acquisition locale. Its baseline profile uses no proxy or browser.
- Amazon.com has one committed product-page regression fixture and historical
  probes; full marketplace support remains deferred (R4). Amazon.co.uk and
  Amazon.it profile entries are not validated support. The `.it` profile uses
  German labels; unknown domains fall back to English. Do not treat successful
  parsing or a profile entry as proof that a marketplace is supported.
- Three category analyzers ship: `dry_pasta`, `tyre_mounting_paste`, and
  `basmati_rice`. Their defaults reflect particular use cases; a ranking alone
  does not establish suitability for a new question.
- These commands produce analysis, not an automatically verified purchase
  report. The researcher still establishes requirements, checks external
  sources, writes the report, and records the limits of the evidence.

## Setup and first check

Run commands from the repository root. The project uses CPython **3.14** and
Scrapy **2.19.x**, with dependencies declared in `pyproject.toml` and pinned in
`uv.lock`. Install `uv` using your environment's package manager if absent.
Setup may download the interpreter and packages; the example below is offline
after setup.

Both PowerShell and POSIX shells:

```text
uv sync --locked
uv run --offline --locked python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

`--locked` checks that the committed lock matches the project; do not regenerate
it as a side effect of ordinary research. No virtualenv activation is needed.

**The default crawl profile is the validated, proxy-free local one** (T1). It
needs no API key and no optional packages, and it asks Amazon.de for German.
`SCRAPY_PROJECT` no longer has to be set; `SCRAPY_PROJECT=baseline` still
selects the same profile, so existing commands keep working.

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONIOENCODING = 'utf-8'
uv run --offline --locked scrapy list
```

POSIX shell:

```sh
export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
uv run --offline --locked scrapy list
```

The expected spider list is just `amazon_product`. Listing spiders makes no
marketplace requests. The encoding variable applies to subsequent commands in
the same shell; a newly opened shell needs it again.

Start with the [offline research walkthrough](RESEARCH.md#offline-walkthrough).
It uses committed evidence, requires no account, and shows both a usable
comparison and a disputed value that must not decide a purchase.

## Architecture

| Layer | Entry points | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Acquisition | `amazon_scraper/spiders/amazon_product.py` | Search and direct ASIN requests, deduplication, challenge detection, coverage stats |
| Run evidence | `amazon_scraper/run.py` | Manifest, discovery log, retained PDPs and their fetch metadata, bounded failure samples, offline re-extraction |
| Provenance | `amazon_scraper/provenance.py`, `amazon_scraper/redaction.py` | Code/settings identity, artefact digests, atomic manifest writes, page redaction |
| Extraction | `amazon_scraper/extraction/` | Amazon structures and locale profiles; raw and normalized data, per-block diagnostics |
| Validation | `amazon_scraper/validation/` | Quantity, pricing, nutrition, review and variation checks; evidence-bearing values |
| Category analysis | `amazon_scraper/analysis/categories/` | Classification, meaningful claims and comparison axes; category plausibility profiles |
| Analysis CLI | `amazon_scraper/analysis/__main__.py`, `report.py`, `feeds.py` | Feed merging, evidence cards, rankings, comparisons and summaries |

`items.py`, `pipelines.py`, and `middlewares.py` are inherited scaffolding;
they are not the research data model. The product spider emits dictionaries.
The core contract is `PdpExtractor.extract(...) -> record`, followed by
`validate(record, profile) -> Validated`, then a category's `evaluate(record)`.

### Evidence and trust

Every validated value distinguishes **source** (how it was obtained) from
**status** (which checks it survived), with quotes and field references.
`trusted`, `disputed`, `unverified`, `unknown`, and `not_claimed` have distinct
meanings; see [the contract](CONTRACT.md#status-vocabulary).

A trusted vendor declaration establishes that the page makes the claim; it is
not independent proof of product performance. Absence of a claim is not proof
it is false. The sampled review cards cannot establish a complaint rate.
Disputed numeric values are shown with their contradictions and are not used
as ranking values.

### Category behavior

| Category | Default `rank` axis | Additional evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `dry_pasta` | Price per kilogram, lower first | Ingredients, processing claims, nutrition plausibility |
| `tyre_mounting_paste` | Pack quantity, lower first | Drying, material compatibility, adverse lubricant claims |
| `basmati_rice` | Price per kilogram, lower first | Cultivar, review signals, historical external findings, a seven-component score on text cards |

`rank` sorts one axis. **It does not rank by basmati's composite score**.
Basmati's JSON card currently omits the score and several category-specific
evidence sections; consult the text card and module when researching it.
`--require` filters on an observed trusted claim, not independent certification.
Use explicit `--category`; the CLI otherwise defaults to `dry_pasta`.

`rank` produces one ordering over one axis in one unit, and refuses rather
than inventing a comparison: an axis the category declares no better direction
for is not ranked at all, and an axis measured in more than one unit needs
`--unit`. Both refusals name what to do instead.

Variants are grouped using Amazon's variation matrices: pack sizes can share
an offer, while non-size dimensions are retained. Missing matrices do not
justify guessed product identity. Listing identity — merging and family
grouping alike — is the normalised marketplace plus the ASIN. An analysis
still covers one marketplace: feeds spanning several stop the command until
`--marketplace` names one.

### Commands

| Command | Output |
|---|---|
| `python -m amazon_scraper.analysis summary FEED --category CATEGORY` | Classification decisions, evidence availability and trust statuses; not classifier accuracy |
| `... rank FEED --category CATEGORY --limit 10` | One-axis ranking, pack variants and exclusions |
| `... card FEED ASIN [ASIN ...] --category CATEGORY` | Text evidence cards; `--json` emits one pretty-printed object per ASIN |
| `... cards FEED --category CATEGORY --json` | JSONL cards for category matches; category extras are not yet complete |
| `... compare FEED ASIN ASIN --category CATEGORY` | Differences supported by comparable values and reasons for refusal |
| `... validated FEED --category CATEGORY` | JSONL validation using that category's plausibility profile; no category claim evaluation |
| `python -m amazon_scraper.run reextract RUN_DIR --feed ORIGINAL_FEED -o NEW_FEED` | Offline extraction from retained pages; refuses a feed belonging to another crawl or marketplace |
| `python -m amazon_scraper.run inspect RUN_DIR` | What a run did, which code and settings produced it, how it ended, what it retained |

Run these with `uv run --offline --locked`. The analysis commands accept
multiple JSONL or `.jsonl.gz` feeds. They merge by marketplace and ASIN and
choose the newest `fetched_at`; a tie falls to a declared order (newer schema,
then a later re-extraction of the same bytes, then run id and a record digest),
so the argument order never decides. Feeds from several marketplaces stop the
command until `--marketplace` names one. JSON output puts the provenance
summary on stderr; do not combine stderr with the data stream. `--json`
formats cards, not a structured ranking or summary.

The `validated` CLI always supplies a category profile (default `dry_pasta`).
For neutral validation, the Python API is `validate(record)` with no profile;
that is also what the saved-page validation snapshots test. There is no
neutral CLI switch today.

## Collecting and retaining evidence

Use the [bounded live workflow](RESEARCH.md#live-collection) after recording the
question and collection limits. Keep the baseline pacing: concurrency 1,
9-second configured delay with jitter and AutoThrottle. Do not infer that an
old successful fast crawl is a current rate recommendation.

| Spider argument | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `keyword` | Semicolon-separated queries; defaults to `spaghetti hartweizen` |
| `asin` | Named ASINs or product URLs; explicit ASINs alone suppress the default query |
| `domain` | Defaults to `www.amazon.de` |
| `max_pages` | Search pages per query, default 2 |
| `max_products_per_query` | Per-query discovery cap; default 0 means unlimited |
| `keep_pages` | Default 1; keep it enabled for replay |
| `keep_search_pages` | Default 0. Retains search responses, which are the only witness to what a query returned — and the largest thing a crawl downloads |

The product feed is written wherever `-O` specifies; there is no automatic CSV
feed. `-O` overwrites that output, so choose a new path for each collection.
Nested product records should be stored as JSONL. Each crawl separately writes:

```text
data/runs/<run_id>/manifest.json      arguments, locale, code, settings, feeds, state
data/runs/<run_id>/discovery.jsonl    every sighting, before deduplication
data/runs/<run_id>/pages.jsonl        per artefact: fetch time, URLs, status, digest
data/runs/<run_id>/pages/<ASIN>.html.gz
data/runs/<run_id>/quarantine/        pages whose redaction failed — not exportable
data/runs/<run_id>/failures/          bounded samples of challenges and parse failures
data/runs/<run_id>/search/            search responses, with keep_search_pages=1
```

Failure samples are capped per reason and truncated, and are retained whether
or not `keep_pages` is set: a crawl that retains nothing still has to be able
to explain what it did not get.

Run IDs are unique and the directory is created exclusively, so two crawls
started in the same second cannot share one. The manifest is written
atomically and carries its own state: a crawl that never closed reads as
`interrupted` rather than as a finished one. It also records the code revision,
lock digest, schema/contract versions and an allowlist of acquisition settings
— never a credential — so a later reader can say which code produced the
evidence.

`pages.jsonl` records when each page was fetched and the SHA-256 of the bytes
actually stored. That digest is over the **redacted** text, not over Amazon's
reply. Because fetch time is recorded rather than read from the filesystem,
copying a run directory no longer makes its pages look freshly fetched.
Portable study manifests remain T2 work; see the
[runbook limitations](RESEARCH.md#current-limitations).

## Maintenance and reference material

Use [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#maintenance-workflow) for the change and verification
sequence. The regression suite includes 39 saved PDPs (38 `.de`, one `.com`),
a search page, and category cases. Read [corpus instructions](tests/corpus/README.md)
before promoting a capture or regenerating snapshots. A snapshot update is
a reviewed behavior change, not a routine way to fix a failing test.

Adding a category normally means a module under `analysis/categories/`, registered
through that package's `__init__.py`, plus tests. Start at `Category`, `Axis`,
`Claim`, and `CategoryProfile`; keep generic trust rules in validation. Use
`Marketplace.word(stem)` for supported locale-aware word boundaries and the
contract's attributed search controls where appropriate. See R7/R8 in the roadmap.

Historical evidence and its limits:

- [BASELINE.md](BASELINE.md): original 2026-09-14 setup and smoke measurement.
- [EXTRACTION.md](EXTRACTION.md): extraction investigation and dated coverage.
- [USABILITY.md](USABILITY.md): basmati research postmortem and later resolutions.
- [data/evidence](data/evidence/README.md): committed crawl evidence for decisions.
- [reports](reports/README.md): output conventions; complete original study
  inputs and finished reports are not all committed.

### Legacy search-spider migration

T0 removed `amazon_search` after a tracked-reference inventory found no code or
test consumer outside the spider itself. It hardcoded an iPad query on `.com`
and emitted a different CSV record shape. Use `amazon_product` with explicit
`keyword`/`asin`, locale and bounds. Its `discovery.jsonl` records search
sightings; its JSONL feed contains product details. This is not a drop-in
replacement for the old CSV shape or a search-only crawl. Historical documents
retain the old name as part of their original measurements.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Action |
|---|---|
| `ModuleNotFoundError: scrapeops_scrapy` | Only the opt-in ScrapeOps profile needs it. Unset `SCRAPY_PROJECT` (or set it to `baseline`) and check `scrapy list`. |
| Locale conflict on startup | Confirm baseline/German headers and `.de`; do not bypass the check. |
| No or few records | Inspect manifest challenge/HTTP/parse counters, query coverage, and caps. HTTP 200 or `finished` is not proof of usable coverage. |
| uv cache is not writable | Set `UV_CACHE_DIR` to a writable directory; `data/.uv-cache` is an ignored local option. Retry locked setup. |
| Offline dependency error | Complete `uv sync --locked` first; offline mode cannot download missing packages or Python. |
| Unicode output error | Set `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` as above; use UTF-8 when saving reports. |

For the cache override, use `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR = 'data/.uv-cache'` in PowerShell
or `export UV_CACHE_DIR=data/.uv-cache` in a POSIX shell. Do not delete a shared
cache or change dependency versions to work around a filesystem error.

The optional ScrapeOps profile is `SCRAPY_PROJECT=scrapeops` and requires
`uv sync --locked --extra scrapeops` plus `SCRAPEOPS_API_KEY` in the
environment; no key is stored in the repository. It is **not validated**:
every measurement here was taken without a proxy, so its pacing, challenge
rate and the prices a proxied IP is shown are unknown. Treat a study collected
through it as a different acquisition path and say so in the report. The run
manifest records which profile answered and whether a proxy middleware was in
the request path.
